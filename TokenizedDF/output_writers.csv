Masanobu Fukuoka,Japanese writers,Writers,"Masanobu Fukuoka (Japanese: 福岡 正信, Hepburn: Fukuoka Masanobu, 2 February 1913 – 16 August 2008) was a Japanese farmer and philosopher celebrated for his natural farming and re-vegetation of desertified lands. He was a proponent of no-till, herbicide and pesticide free cultivation methods from which he created a particular method of agriculture, commonly referred to as ""natural farming"" or ""do-nothing farming"".Fukuoka was the author of several books, scientific papers and other publications, and was featured in television documentaries and interviews from the 1970s onwards. His influences went beyond farming to inspire individuals within the natural food and lifestyle movements. He was an outspoken advocate of the value of observing nature's principles. Life Fukuoka was born on 2 February 1913 in Iyo, Ehime, Japan, the second son of Kameichi Fukuoka, an educated and wealthy land owner and local leader. He attended Gifu Prefecture Agricultural College and trained as a microbiologist and agricultural scientist, beginning a career as a research scientist specialising in plant pathology. He worked at the Plant Inspection Division of the Yokohama Customs Bureau in 1934 as an agricultural customs inspector. In 1937 he was hospitalised with pneumonia, and while recovering, he stated that he had a profound spiritual experience that transformed his world view and led him to doubt the practices of modern ""Western"" agricultural science. He immediately resigned from his post as a research scientist, returning to his family's farm on the island of Shikoku in southern Japan. From 1938, Fukuoka began to practice and experiment with new techniques on organic citrus orchards and used the observations gained to develop the idea of ""Natural Farming"". Among other practices, he abandoned pruning an area of citrus trees, which caused the trees to become affected by insects and the branches to become entangled. He stated that the experience taught him the difference between nature and non-intervention. His efforts were interrupted by World War II, during which he worked at the Kōchi Prefecture agricultural experiment station on subjects including farming research and food production. In 1940, Fukuoka married his wife Ayako, and they had five children together. After World War II, his father lost most of the family lands in postwar land reform and was left with three-eighths of an acre of rice land and the hillside citrus orchards his son had taken over before the war. Despite these circumstances, in 1947 he took up natural farming again with success, using no-till farming methods to raise rice and barley. He wrote his first book, Mu 1: The God Revolution, or Mu 1: Kami no Kakumei (無〈1〉神の革命) in Japanese, during the same year, and worked to spread word of the benefits of his methods and philosophy. His later book, The One-Straw Revolution, was published in 1975 and translated into English in 1978. From 1979, Fukuoka travelled the world extensively, giving lectures, working directly to plant seeds and re-vegetate areas, and receiving a number of awards in various countries in recognition of his work and achievements. By the 1980s, Fukuoka recorded that he and his family shipped some 6,000 crates of citrus to Tokyo each year, totalling about 90 tonnes.During his first journey overseas, Fukuoka was accompanied by his wife Ayako, met macrobiotic diet leaders Michio Kushi and Herman Aihara, and was guided by his leading supporter and translation editor Larry Korn. They sowed seeds in desertified land, visited the University of California in Berkeley and Los Angeles, the Green Gulch Farm Zen Center, the Lundberg Family Farms, and met with United Nations UNCCD representatives including Maurice Strong, who encouraged Fukuoka's practical involvement in the ""Plan of Action to Combat Desertification"". He also travelled to New York City and surrounding areas such as Boston and Amherst College in Massachusetts. In 1983, he travelled to Europe for 50 days holding workshops, educating farmers and sowing seeds. In 1985, he spent 40 days in Somalia and Ethiopia, sowing seeds to re-vegetate desert areas, including working in remote villages and a refugee camp. The following year he returned to the United States, speaking at three international conferences on natural farming in Washington state, San Francisco and at the Agriculture Department of the University of California, Santa Cruz. Fukuoka also took the opportunity to visit farms, forests and cities giving lectures and meeting people. In 1988, he lectured at the Indian Science Congress, state agricultural universities and other venues. Fukuoka went to Thailand in 1990 and 1991, visiting farms and collecting seeds for re-vegetating deserts in India, which he returned to during November and December that year in an attempt to re-vegetate them. The next year saw him participate in official meetings in Japan associated with the Earth Summit in Rio, Brazil, and in 1996 he returned to Africa, sowing seeds in desert areas of Tanzania, observing baobab trees and jungle country. He taught the making and sowing of clay seed balls in Vietnam during 1995. He travelled to the Philippines in 1998, carrying out Natural Farming research, and visited Greece later that year to assist plans to re-vegetate 10,000 hectares (40 sq. mi.) around the Lake Vegoritida area in the Pella regional unit and to produce a film of the major seed ball effort. The next year he returned to Europe, visiting Mallorca. He visited China in 2001, and in 2002 he returned again to India to speak at the ""Nature as Teacher"" workshop at Navdanya Farm and at Bija Vidyapeeth Earth University in Dehra Dun, Uttarakhand in northern India. On Gandhi's Day, he gave the third annual Albert Howard Memorial Lecture to attendees from all six continents. That autumn he was to visit Afghanistan with Yuko Honma but was unable to attend, shipping eight tons of seed in his stead. In 2005, he gave a brief lecture at the World Expo in Aichi Prefecture, Japan, and in May 2006 he appeared in an hour-long interview on Japanese television network NHK.Masanobu Fukuoka died on 16 August 2008 at the age of 95, after a period of confinement in bed and in a wheelchair. Natural farming Fukuoka called his agricultural philosophy shizen nōhō (自然農法), most commonly translated into English as ""natural farming"". It is also referred to as ""the Fukuoka Method"", ""the natural way of farming"" or ""Do-Nothing Farming"". The system is based on the recognition of the complexity of living organisms that shape an ecosystem and deliberately exploiting it. Fukuoka saw farming not just as a means of producing food but as an aesthetic and spiritual approach to life, the ultimate goal of which was ""the cultivation and perfection of human beings"".The four principles of natural farming are that: human cultivation of soil, plowing or tilling are unnecessary, as is the use of powered machines prepared fertilizers are unnecessary, as is the process of preparing compost weeding, either by cultivation or by herbicides, is unnecessary; instead, only minimal weed suppression with minimal disturbance should be used applications of pesticides or herbicides are unnecessary Clay seed balls Fukuoka re-invented and advanced the use of clay seed balls. Clay seed balls were originally an ancient practice in which seeds for the next season's crops are mixed together, sometimes with humus or compost for microbial inoculants, and then are rolled within clay to form into small balls. This method is now commonly used in guerilla gardening to rapidly seed restricted or private areas. Awards In 1988, Fukuoka received the Visva-Bharati University's Desikottam Award as well as the Ramon Magsaysay Award for Public Service in the Philippines, often considered ""Asia's Nobel Prize"".In March 1997, the Earth Summit5 forum in Rio de Janeiro presented him with the Earth Council Award, received in person at a ceremony in Tokyo on 26 May of that year, honouring him for his contributions to sustainable development.In 1998, Fukuoka received a grant of US$10,000 from the Rockefeller Brothers Fund, but the grant was returned because his advanced age prevented him from completing the project. Influence In the international development of the organic farming movement, Fukuoka is considered to be amongst the ""five giant personalities who inspired the movement"" along with Austrian Rudolf Steiner, German-Swiss Hans Müller, Lady Eve Balfour in the United Kingdom and J. I. Rodale in the United States. His books are considered both farming compendiums and guides to a way of life.: (1) The One-Straw Revolution has been translated into over 20 languages and sold more than one million copies and Fukuoka has been widely influential, inspiring an international movement of individuals discovering and applying his principles to varying degrees, such as Akinori Kimura, David Mas Masumoto and Yoshikazu Kawaguchi, and has significantly influenced alternative movements in the West, such as permaculture.Rosana Tositrakul, a Thai activist and politician, spent a year studying with Fukuoka on his farm. She then organised a visit by Fukuoka to the Kut Chum District of Yasothon Province in northeastern Thailand, which, together with his books, were influential in the rapid and widespread adoption of organic and chemical-free rice farming in the district. Reception In the preface to the US editions of The One-Straw Revolution, Wendell Berry wrote that Fukuoka's techniques are not ""directly applicable to most American farms"", but ultimately concludes that it would be ""a mistake to assume that the practical passages of this book are worthless..."" suggesting that Natural Farming would require farmers to have fresh eyes and the right kind of concern for their land in order to come up with methods relevant to their own farms. Fukuoka's techniques have proven difficult to apply, even on most Japanese farms, and have been described as a sophisticated approach despite their simple appearance. In the initial years of transition from conventional farming there are losses in crop yields. Fukuoka estimated these to be 10% while others, such as Yoshikazu Kawaguchi, have found attempting to strictly follow Fukuoka's techniques led to crop failures and require many years of adaption to make the principles work.In the early 2000's, Theodor Friedrich and Josef Kienzle of the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) opined that his rejection of mechanisation is not justifiable for modern agricultural production and that the system cannot interact effectively with conventional agricultural systems.More recently however, the FAO (along with multiple research universities and organizations such as the Union of Concerned Scientists) have found conventional industrial agriculture systems to be rooted in unsustainable practices that ignore basic biology and the needs of ecosystems. Many of Fukuoka's principles are now being incorporated into modern forms of farming that are more biodiverse, less reliant on chemicals and machines, and which produce similar yields while increasing the health of the soil and surrounding environment. In particular, the concepts of non-tillage, relay cropping, cover-cropping, and plant biodiversity have been shown to prevent soil loss, reduce or eliminate the need for pesticides or fertilizers, and reduce flooding, while increasing water retention, and providing habitat for insects that contribute positively to both crop and ecosystem health.In Japan, where Fukuoka had few followers or associates, his critics argue that the ""inner world and the connection between humans and nature does not, however, exhaust reality"" and that he did not give sufficient attention to interpersonal relationships or society. These criticisms were in some ways addressed by the next generation of natural farmers in Japan such as Yoshikazu Kawaguchi, who started a movement of widespread free schools, and yearly conferences to help spread the mindset of natural farming. There are now over 40 learning sites and more than 900 concurrent students in the Japanese natural farming network. Family farm recent developments Fukuoka's farm in Shikoku was taken over by his son and daughter-in-law in the late 1980s, as Fukuoka reached an advanced age. His grandson also took up farming. Many of the farm's iyokan and amanatsu mikan trees remain, although some old iyokan were replaced by new varieties of fruit. Woodlands remain along with orchards, including some areas of wild vegetables still growing amongst them. Some areas of straw-mulched cropping continue to produce grains and vegetables. The farm also features an orchard area of ginkgo trees, shiitake mushroom crops growing on tree logs in shady woodland, and plantings of limes, grapefruits, feijoas, avocados and mangoes.The farm is now run using some natural farming techniques: no chemicals, no tillage of the land and no use of composting. Other techniques have been changed; the pattern of irrigation is more conventional to reduce conflicts with neighbours. A do-nothing philosophy has been followed on the hilltop surrounding Fukuoka's hut. Here it has become a natural, fruit-bearing forest with minimal intervention.

re-vegetation of desertified lands.', 'He was a proponent of no-till, herbicide and pesticide free cultivation methods from which he created a particular method of agriculture, commonly referred to as ""natural farming"" or ""do-nothing farming"".', 'Fukuoka was the author of several books, scientific papers and other publications, and was featured in television documentaries and interviews from the 1970s onwards.', 'His influences went beyond farming to inspire individuals within the natural food and lifestyle movements.', ""He was an outspoken advocate of the value of observing nature's principles."", 'Life Fukuoka was born on 2 February 1913 in Iyo, Ehime, Japan, the second son of Kameichi Fukuoka, an educated and wealthy land owner and local leader.', 'He attended Gifu Prefecture Agricultural College and trained as a microbiologist and agricultural scientist, beginning a career as a research scientist specialising in plant pathology.', 'He worked at the Plant Inspection Division of the Yokohama Customs Bureau in 1934 as an agricultural customs inspector.', 'In 1937 he was hospitalised with pneumonia, and while recovering, he stated that he had a profound spiritual experience that transformed his world view and led him to doubt the practices of modern ""Western"" agricultural science.', ""He immediately resigned from his post as a research scientist, returning to his family's farm on the island of Shikoku in southern Japan."", 'From 1938, Fukuoka began to practice and experiment with new techniques on organic citrus orchards and used the observations gained to develop the idea of ""Natural Farming"".', 'Among other practices, he abandoned pruning an area of citrus trees, which caused the trees to become affected by insects and the branches to become entangled.', 'He stated that the experience taught him the difference between nature and non-intervention.', 'His efforts were interrupted by World War II, during which he worked at the Kōchi Prefecture agricultural experiment station on subjects including farming research and food production.', 'In 1940, Fukuoka married his wife Ayako, and they had five children together.', 'After World War II, his father lost most of the family lands in postwar land reform and was left with three-eighths of an acre of rice land and the hillside citrus orchards his son had taken over before the war.', 'Despite these circumstances, in 1947 he took up natural farming again with success, using no-till farming methods to raise rice and barley.', 'He wrote his first book, Mu 1: The God Revolution, or Mu 1: Kami no Kakumei (無〈1〉神の革命) in Japanese, during the same year, and worked to spread word of the benefits of his methods and philosophy.', 'His later book, The One-Straw Revolution, was published in 1975 and translated into English in 1978.', 'From 1979, Fukuoka travelled the world extensively, giving lectures, working directly to plant seeds and re-vegetate areas, and receiving a number of awards in various countries in recognition of his work and achievements.', 'By the 1980s, Fukuoka recorded that he and his family shipped some 6,000 crates of citrus to Tokyo each year, totalling about 90 tonnes.', 'During his first journey overseas, Fukuoka was accompanied by his wife Ayako, met macrobiotic diet leaders Michio Kushi and Herman Aihara, and was guided by his leading supporter and translation editor Larry Korn.', 'They sowed seeds in desertified land, visited the University of California in Berkeley and Los Angeles, the Green Gulch Farm Zen Center, the Lundberg Family Farms, and met with United Nations UNCCD representatives including Maurice Strong, who encouraged Fukuoka\'s practical involvement in the ""Plan of Action to Combat Desertification"".', 'He also travelled to New York City and surrounding areas such as Boston and Amherst College in Massachusetts.', 'In 1983, he travelled to Europe for 50 days holding workshops, educating farmers and sowing seeds.', 'In 1985, he spent 40 days in Somalia and Ethiopia, sowing seeds to re-vegetate desert areas, including working in remote villages and a refugee camp.', 'The following year he returned to the United States, speaking at three international conferences on natural farming in Washington state, San Francisco and at the Agriculture Department of the University of California, Santa Cruz.', 'Fukuoka also took the opportunity to visit farms, forests and cities giving lectures and meeting people.', 'In 1988, he lectured at the Indian Science Congress, state agricultural universities and other venues.', 'Fukuoka went to Thailand in 1990 and 1991, visiting farms and collecting seeds for re-vegetating deserts in India, which he returned to during November and December that year in an attempt to re-vegetate them.', 'The next year saw him participate in official meetings in Japan associated with the Earth Summit in Rio, Brazil, and in 1996 he returned to Africa, sowing seeds in desert areas of Tanzania, observing baobab trees and jungle country.', 'He taught the making and sowing of clay seed balls in Vietnam during 1995.', 'He travelled to the Philippines in 1998, carrying

James Gregory (prison officer),South African writers,Writers,"James Gregory (7 November 1941 – 2003) was the censor officer and prison guard of Nelson Mandela for many years of his captivity. He later wrote the book Goodbye Bafana: Nelson Mandela, My Prisoner, My Friend, on which the 2007 film Goodbye Bafana was based. The book, and later the film, are based on the idea that Gregory and Mandela had developed a friendship despite being prison guard and prisoner, respectively. Mandela's view of Gregory In his autobiography, Long Walk to Freedom, Mandela briefly mentions Gregory on two occasions. The first was during his imprisonment in Pollsmoor Prison: ""Often, Winnie's visits were overseen by Warrant Officer James Gregory, who had been a censor on Robben Island. I had not known him terribly well, but he knew us, because he had been responsible for reviewing our incoming and outgoing mail. At Pollsmoor I got to know Gregory better and found him a welcome contrast to the typical warder. He was polished and soft-spoken, and treated Winnie with courtesy and deference"". Instead of barking, 'Time up!' he would say, 'Mrs Mandela, you have five more minutes.' The second occasion that Mandela mentions Gregory in his autobiography is on the day of his release in 1990 from prison: ""Warrant Officer James Gregory was also there at the house, and I embraced him warmly. In the years that he had looked after me from Pollsmoor through Victor Verster, we had never discussed politics, but our bond was an unspoken one and I would miss his soothing presence"". The Making Of video for the film Goodbye Bafana contains an interview with Nelson Mandela where he speaks of James Gregory as follows: He was one of the most refined warders. Well-informed and courteous with everybody. Soft spoken. Very good observations. I developed a lot of respect for him. Criticism Gregory's claims were disputed by one of Mandela's biographers, Anthony Sampson. Sampson's biography said that Gregory was pretending to be Mandela's friend in prison, so that he could make money. According to Sampson, the close relationship depicted in Gregory's book, Goodbye Bafana, was a fabrication, and in reality Gregory rarely spoke to Mandela. Gregory censored the letters sent to the future president and thus discovered the details of Mandela's personal life, which he sold in Goodbye Bafana. Sampson said that Mandela considered suing Gregory, but refrained from doing so when the Prison Department distanced itself from Gregory's book. Sampson also said that other warders had told him in interviews that they suspected Gregory of spying for the government.Mandela later invited Gregory to his inauguration as President, apparently having forgiven him as he had the former president P.W. Botha, and the prosecutor Dr. Percy Yutar who had tried to get him executed in the Rivonia Trial.

The Theocrat (Novel),Moroccan writers,Writers,"The Theocrat is the 1990 novel by the Moroccan author and former minister of culture Bensalem Himmich. It was published by Dar Al-Shorouk publishing, and it was considered one of the most influential Arabic novels due to its centering old Arab history. In his novel, Himmich revives the character of al-Hakim bi-Amr Illah (""the ruler by order of God""), the Fatimid caliph who ruled Egypt during the tenth century. The Arab Writers Union considered is among the most important 105 novels of the 20th century. Additionally, it also enjoys a high status among historical Arabic fiction, for the novel takes inspiration from facts, events, and historical personalities. The Translation “The Theocrat” was translated into English by the Comparative and Arabic Literature professor at Pennsylvania University, Roger Allen, after taking a liking to it and recognizing its value. He said, “it is a novel revealing the highest level of culture, and his narrative style aligns with the techniques of writing.” He was particularly interested in the author's ability to connect past and present, which prompted him to translate the novel into English. He clarified that this new edition also connects past and present, with some mild differences that do not affect its core. He also mentioned that this is one of the Arabic novels raising awareness regarding the importance of dismantling fascism. Criticism The novel was critiqued by the judging panel given the “Naqid” or “Critique” Award. The panel mentioned the author's attempt at processing and critiquing the present based on the judgment of al-Hakim bi-Amr Illah, not abiding by the traditional majority of historical novels; therefore, limiting fictional tension between fictional imagery and storylines. This infused the novel with historic-ness, for he made the subject, style, and structure a complete artistic work. One of its perks is its ability to benefit from oral storytelling, which is linguistically, historically, psychologically, and socially rich.

Laco Novomeský,Slovak writers,Writers,"Laco Novomeský (full name: Ladislav Novomeský) (27 December 1904, Budapest — 4 September 1976, Bratislava) was a Slovak poet, writer and communist politician. Novomeský was a member of the DAV group; after The Second World War he was commissioner of education and culture of Socialist Czechoslovakia. A prominent Czechoslovak politician, he was persecuted in the 1950s and later rehabilitated in the 1960s. Early life Novomeský was born in to the family of a tailor that immigrated from Senica to Budapest, where he was born. The family moved back to Senica to continue his studies. He later graduated from the teacher training institute in Modra. Novomeský started to work as a teacher while at the same time enrolling as an external student of the Faculty of Arts at the Comenius University where he became involved in literary and political activities. Literary and political career He joined the Communist Party of Czechoslovakia in 1925 and worked for its press. He was the editor of the Communist Party's newspaper Pravda (previously it was named the Truth of Poverty).In 1927 he was arrested by the Czechoslovak authorities for press offence and sentenced to 10 years in prison however he was released by bail. He went to Prague and joined the group of left-wing intellectuals around the DAV magazine.The members of DAV also had influence in the Youth Club (sk. Klub mladých), which joined to the Art discussion club of Slovakia (sk. Umelecká beseda), which together with the DAV organized book-reading parties with poetry of important Slovak writers like Lukáč, Smrek, Novomeský and Okáli. DAV supported internationalism on the one hand, and too equality between Slovaks and Czechs. The concept of DAV connected the political line on the one hand, and the aesthetic line on the other hand. After the ban on the DAV project (by representatives of the new Slovak state), individual members (Urx, Novomeský, Husák, Clementis) participated in the organization of the Slovak National Uprising 1944 (Eduard Urx was even executed by the Nazis; Gustav Husak was one of the most important organizers of the Slovak National Uprising 1944). Ex-DAV members, Husák, Okáli, Clementis and Novomeský became part of the government in exile (in London) and after the end of the war they took part in taking power.Novomeský rejected the Manifesto of the Seven and supported Klement Gottwald and the Sovietisation of the Communist Party of Czechoslovakia. He wrote against the seven left-wing intellectuals and called for the intellectual left to support the new Party line by saying ""The intellectual left cannot stand above the party"". In 1936, the Spanish Civil War broke out against general Franco's insurgency, in which Novomeský became involved in Czechoslovakia by organizing International Brigades (he also founded the Club of Friends of Spain). A year later, he participated in the congress in Paris and became a direct participant in the fighting (he got directly to the Czechoslovak combat units fighting the fascists) and the congress of the International Association of Writers for the Defense of Culture in Valencia, Barcelona and Madrid. Many of his memoirs about the Civil War were later published.In 1939 he moved back to Slovakia and continued his communist activities despite the ban of the Party. In August 1943, together with his younger friend Gustav Husák, he became a member of the 5th illegal leadership of the Communist Party of Slovakia, led by Karol Šmidke . He was one of the leading organizers of the Slovak National uprising. He was also a co-founder and vice-chairman of the insurgent Slovak National Council in 1943 which later became the highest legislative and executive body in socialist Slovakia. In the Czechoslovak Socialist Republic After the war he became a member of the Central committee of the Communist Party of Czechoslovakia and the Commissioner of Education from 1945 to 1950 as well as a member of the Constituent National Assembly.At the congress of the Communist Party of Slovakia in 1950, he was accused of 'bourgeois nationalism' and was arrested on 6 February 1951, together with Gustav Husák. In 1954 he was sentenced to 10 years in prison in a staged trial with a subversive group of bourgeois nationalists. While Gustáv Husák was not completely broken in custody and tried to oppose the investigators, Novomeský and other accusers cooperated with the security forces and confessed to all the fabricated points. He could not publish at this time. In prison, he wrote 4,000 poems on tobacco papers, but smoked most of them. On 22 December 1955 he was released on parole. Zolo Mikeš wrote (Aktuality.sk) Novomeský's statements were used in the Slánsky trial against his friend Vladimir Clementis, thus contributing to his death sentence. Novomeský then lived in Prague and was not allowed to return to Bratislava and was under police supervision. Then, until 1962, he worked at the Monument of National Literature in Prague. In 1963, Novomeský was fully rehabilitated. He moved to Bratislava, where he worked at the Institute of Slovak Literature of the Slovak Academy of Sciences. After the Warsaw Pact invasion on 21 August 1968, he again became a member of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of Czechoslovakia, and in the same year he also chaired the Matica slovenská.

Biography McWatt was born in Guyana, attending many schools throughout the country due to his father's position as a district officer. McWatt attended the University of Toronto (1966–70) and Leeds University, where he studied the works of Wilson Harris and completed a Ph.D. in 1975. He took a position at the University of the West Indies, Cave Hill campus, Barbados, as an assistant lecturer, then moved up to Professor of West Indian Literature in 1999, until retiring in 2007 as Professor Emeritus.He was founding editor, in 1986, of the Journal of West Indian Literature and published three collections of poetry, the second of which, The Language of Eldorado (1994), was awarded the Guyana Prize. His first work of fiction, Suspended Sentences, was the winner of a Commonwealth Writers' Prize in 2006, as well as the Casa de las Américas Prize for best book of Caribbean Literature in English or Creole. A review of Suspended Sentences in the Journal of West Indian Literature called it ""haunting, magical and profane"".He co-edited the literature compilations Oxford Book of Caribbean Verse and The Caribbean Short Story: Critical Perspectives. McWatt has said his poetry was inspired first by the Guyana landscape, and how it can ""at once alter and respond to interior states"". His poems reflect his views of the natural world and the supernatural, including a vampire of Caribbean folklore (""Ol' Higue""), and of marriage and domesticity (""A Man in the House"").

Nicolas Notovitch,Russian writers,Writers,"Shulim or Nikolai Aleksandrovich Notovich (Russian: Николай Александрович Нотович) (August 13, 1858 – after 1916), known in the West as Nicolas Notovitch, was a Crimean Jewish adventurer who claimed to be a Russian aristocrat, spy and journalist. Notovitch is known for his 1894 book claiming that during the unknown years of Jesus, he left Galilee for India and studied with Buddhists and Hindus before returning to Judea. Notovitch's claim was based on a document he said he had seen at the Hemis Monastery while he stayed there. The consensus view amongst modern scholars is that Notovitch's account of the travels of Jesus to India was a hoax.Notovitch also wrote some political books on the role of Russia in war. Life of Saint Issa Notovitch's 1894 book La vie inconnue de Jesus Christ (Life of Saint Issa) claims that during his unknown years, Jesus left Galilee for India and studied with Buddhists and Hindus there before returning to Judea. Outline of the book After breaking his leg in India and while recovering from it at the Hemis monastery in Ladakh, Notovitch learned of the Tibetan manuscript Life of Saint Issa, Best of the Sons of Men—Isa being the Arabic name of Jesus in Islam. Notovitch's account, with the text of the Life, was published in French in 1894 as La vie inconnue de Jésus-Christ. It was translated into English, German, Spanish, and Italian. Allegations of forgery and alleged confession Notovitch's book generated controversy as soon as it was published. The philologist Max Müller expressed incredulity at the account presented and suggested that either Notovitch was the victim of a practical joke or he had fabricated the evidence. Müller wrote: ""Taking it for granted that M. Notovitch is a gentleman and not a liar, we cannot help thinking that the Buddhist monks of Ladakh and Tibet must be wags, who enjoy mystifying inquisitive travelers, and that M. Notovitch fell far too easy a victim to their jokes."" Müller then wrote to the head lama at Hemis monastery to ask about the document and Notovitch's story. The head lama replied that there had been no western visitor at the monastery in the previous fifteen years, during which he had been the head lama there, and there were no documents related to Notovitch's story. Other European scholars also opposed Notovitch's account and Indologist Leopold von Schroeder called Notovitch's story a ""big fat lie"".J. Archibald Douglas, who was a professor of English and History at the Government College in Agra, then visited the Hemis monastery to interview the head lama, who stated yet again that Notovitch had never been there and that no such documents existed. Wilhelm Schneemelcher states that Notovich's accounts were soon exposed as fabrications, and that to date no one has even had a glimpse at the manuscripts Notovitch claims to have seen. Notovich at first responded to claims to defend himself. But once his story had been re-examined by historians, Notovitch is said to have confessed to having fabricated the evidence. Bart D. Ehrman, a Biblical scholar, says that ""Today there is not a single recognized scholar on the planet who has any doubts about the matter. The entire story was invented by Notovitch, who earned a good deal of money and a substantial amount of notoriety for his hoax."" However, others deny that Notovich ever accepted the accusations against him. Fida Hassnain, a Kashmiri writer, has stated: Notovitch responded publicly by announcing his existence, along with the names of people he met on his travels in Kashmir and Ladakh. ... He also offered to return to Tibet in company of recognized orientalists to verify the authenticity of the verses contained in his compilation. In the French journal La Paix, he affirmed his belief in the Orthodox Church, and advised his detractors to restrict themselves to the simple issue of the existence of the Buddhist scrolls at Hemis. Although he was not impressed with his story, Sir Francis Younghusband recalls meeting Nicolas Notovitch near Skardu, not long after Notovitch had left Hemis monastery. Claims of corroboration in India Although Notovitch had been discredited in Europe, certain individuals in India and America considered his story to have credibility. Swami Abhedananda, who was a colleague of Max Mueller and initially sceptical of Notovitch's claims, claimed to have visited the Hemis monastery in 1922 whilst travelling through Kashmir and Tibet to verify the reports of Notovich that he had heard the previous year in the U.S. He claimed that lamas at the monastery confirmed to him that Notovich was brought to the monastery with a broken leg and he was nursed there for a month and a half. They also told him that the Tibetan manuscript on Issa was shown to Notovich and its contents interpreted so that he could translate them into Russian. This manuscript was shown to Abhedananda, which had 14 chapters, containing 223 couplets (slokas). The Swami had some portions of the manuscript translated with the help of a lama, about 40 verses of which appeared in the Swami's travelogue. The original Pali manuscript—allegedly composed after Christ's resurrection—was said to be in the monastery of Marbour near Lhasa.After his return to Bengal, the Swami asked his assistant Bhairab Chaitanya to prepare a manuscript of the travelogue based on the notes he had taken. The manuscript was published serially in Visvavani, a monthly publication of the Ramakrishna Vedanta Samiti, in 1927 and subsequently published in a book form in Bengali. The fifth edition of the book in English was published in 1987, which also contains an English translation of Notovich's Life of Saint Issa as an appendix.Paramahansa Yogananda wrote that Nicholas Roerich also corroborated Notovich's and Abhedananda's story during his visit to Tibet in the mid-1920s. He also wrote that ""records of Jesus's years in India were preserved in Puri, according to Bharati Krishna Tirtha, and that after leaving Puri Jesus spent ""six years with the Sakya Buddhist sect in... Nepal and Tibet"", before returning to Palestine. He added that ""the overall value of these records is inestimable in a search for the historical Jesus"". Other authors' references Author Alice Dunbar Nelson includes a review of The Unknown Life of Jesus Christ in her 1895 collection Violets and Other Tales. In 1899 Mirza Ghulam Ahmad wrote Jesus in India (published in 1908) and claimed that Jesus had traveled to India after surviving his crucifixion, but specifically disagreed with Notovitch that Jesus had gone to India before then.Other authors have taken these themes and incorporated it into their own works. For example, in her book The Lost Years of Jesus: Documentary Evidence of Jesus' 17-Year Journey to the East, Elizabeth Clare Prophet asserts that Buddhist manuscripts provide evidence that Jesus traveled to India, Nepal, Ladakh and Tibet. In his book Jesus Lived in India, German author Holger Kersten promoted the ideas of Nicolas Notovich and Mirza Ghulam Ahmad. Gerald O'Collins classified Kersten's work as the repackaging of the same stories. In his 2002 comedic novel Lamb: The Gospel According to Biff, Christ's Childhood Pal, absurdist author Christopher Moore parodies the notion that between the ages of 15 and 30, Jesus traveled to Tibet to study Buddhism in a monastery (after first having traveled to Afghanistan), then to India to study Hinduism. Other writings In 1906 Notovitch published a book in Russian and French, pleading for Russia's entry into the Triple Entente with France and England. It is entitled in French: La Russie et l'alliance anglaise: étude historique et politique. He also wrote biographies of Tsar Nicolas II and Alexander III. He had also written L'Europe à la veille de la guerre.

Morita Sōhei,Japanese writers,Writers,"Morita Yonematsu (19 March 1881 – 14 December 1949; Japanese: 万戸 満平), known under pen name Morita Sōhei (Japanese: 森田 草平, もりた そうへい), was a novelist and translator of Western literature active during the late Meiji, Taishō and early Shōwa periods of Japan. Early life Morita was born into a farming family what is now Gifu, Gifu Prefecture. At the age of 15, he was selected for the Imperial Japanese Navy's preparatory course, and sent to boarding school in Tokyo. He managed to avoid conscription into the military, and attended what is now Kanazawa University, where he met his future wife, and then went on to graduate from Tokyo Imperial University. He returned to Gifu, but remained drawn to literature, especially the works of Natsume Sōseki, and of various English and Russian writers, he left his wife and returned to Tokyo to pursue a career in the literary world. Literary career Morita approached Yosano Tekkan, editor of the influential literary magazine Myōjō for assistance in an introduction to Natsume Sōseki in an effort to become accepted as one of Soseki's students. Tekkan not only introduced Morita to Soseki, but also introduced him to the famous feminist activist and author Hiratsuka Raicho. Morita won critical acclaim and acceptance as a serious writer with his novel Baien (Smoke, 1909), a largely autobiographical account of his unhappy marriage, subsequent affair with Hiratsuka Raicho, and their unsuccessful attempt to commit double suicide in Nasushiobara, Tochigi. The novel appeared in serialized format in the Asahi Shimbun newspaper. From 1920-1930, Morita taught as a professor of English literature at Hosei University. During this time, he published a large biography of Natsume Sōseki, and the novel Rinmei (Reincarnation, 1923–1925). His house in Setagaya, Tokyo was destroyed during the bombing of Tokyo in World War II, and he relocated to Iida, Nagano for the remainder of the war. He turned to historical fiction in his later years, with the novel Hosokawa Garashiya fujin (1949–1950), based on the life of the famous Christian convert Hosokawa Gracia. In addition to his own writings, Morita translated the works of Fyodor Dostoevsky, Henrik Ibsen, Miguel de Cervantes, Gabriele D'Annunzio, and Giovanni Boccaccio into Japanese.

Baltasar Gracián,Spanish writers,Writers,"Baltasar Gracián y Morales, S.J. (Spanish: [baltaˈsaɾ ɣɾaˈθjan]; 8 January 1601 – 6 December 1658), better known as Baltasar Gracián, was a Spanish Jesuit and baroque prose writer and philosopher. He was born in Belmonte, near Calatayud (Aragón). His writings were lauded by Schopenhauer and Nietzsche. Biography The son of a doctor, in his childhood Gracián lived with his uncle, who was a priest. He studied at a Jesuit school in 1621 and 1623 and theology in Zaragoza. He was ordained in 1627 and took his final vows in 1635. He assumed the vows of the Jesuits in 1633 and dedicated himself to teaching in various Jesuit schools. He spent time in Huesca, where he befriended the local scholar Vincencio Juan de Lastanosa, who helped him achieve an important milestone in his intellectual upbringing. He acquired fame as a preacher, although some of his oratorical displays, such as reading a letter sent from Hell from the pulpit, were frowned upon by his superiors. He was named Rector of the Jesuit College of Tarragona and wrote works proposing models for courtly conduct such as El héroe (The Hero), El político (The Politician), and El discreto (The Discreet One). During the Spanish war, he was chaplain of the army that liberated Lérida in 1646. In 1651, he published the first part of the El Criticón (Faultfinder) without the permission of his superiors, whom he disobeyed repeatedly. That attracted the Society's displeasure. Ignoring the reprimands, he published the second part of Criticón in 1657 and so he was sanctioned and exiled to Graus in early 1658. Soon, Gracián wrote to apply for membership in another religious order. His demand was not met, but his sanction was reduced. In April 1658, he was sent to several minor positions under the college of Tarazona. His physical decline prevented him from attending the provincial congregation of Calatayud and on 6 December 1658 Gracián died in Tarazona, near Zaragoza in the Kingdom of Aragón.Gracián is the most representative writer of the Spanish Baroque literary style known as Conceptismo (Conceptism), of which he was the most important theoretician; his Agudeza y arte de ingenio (Wit and the Art of Inventiveness) is at once a poetic, a rhetoric and an anthology of the conceptist style. The Aragonese village in which he was born, Belmonte de Calatayud, changed its name to Belmonte de Gracián in his honour. El Criticón The three parts of the El Criticón, published in 1651, 1653 and 1657, achieved fame in Europe, especially in German-speaking countries. It is the author's masterpiece and one of the great works of the Siglo de Oro. It is a lengthy allegorical novel with philosophical overtones. It recalls the Byzantine style of novel in its many vicissitudes and in the numerous adventures to which the characters are subjected, as well as the picaresque novel in its satirical take on society, as evidenced in the long pilgrimage undertaken by the main characters: Critilo, the ""critical man"" who personifies disillusionment, and Andrenio, the ""natural man"" who represents innocence and primitive impulses. The author constantly exhibits a perspectivist technique that unfolds according to the criteria or points of view of both characters, but in an antithetical rather than plural way as in Miguel de Cervantes. The novel reveals a philosophy, pessimism, with which one of its greatest readers and admirers, the 19th century German philosopher Arthur Schopenhauer, identified. The following is a summary of the El criticón, reduced almost to the point of a sketch, of a complex work that demands detailed study. Critilo, man of the world, is shipwrecked on the coast of the island of Santa Elena, where he meets Andrenio, the natural man, who has grown up completely ignorant of civilization. Together they undertake a long voyage to the Isle of Immortality, travelling the long and prickly road of life. In the first part, ""En la primavera de la niñez"" (""In the Spring of Childhood""), they join the royal court, where they suffer all manner of disappointments; in the second part, ""En el otoño de la varonil edad"" (""In the Autumn of the Age of Manliness""), they pass through Aragon, where they visit the house of Salastano (an anagram of the name of Gracián's friend Lastanosa), and travel to France, which the author calls the ""wasteland of Hipocrinda"", populated entirely by hypocrites and dunces, ending with a visit to a house of lunatics. In the third part, ""En el invierno de la vejez"" (""In the Winter of Old Age""), they arrive in Rome, where they encounter an academy where they meet the most inventive of men, arriving finally at the Isle of Immortality. He is intelligent and contributed greatly to the world. One of his most famous phrases is ""Respect yourself if you would have others respect you."" The Art of Worldly Wisdom Gracián's style, generically called conceptism, is characterized by ellipsis and the concentration of a maximum of significance in a minimum of form, an approach referred to in Spanish as agudeza (wit), and which is brought to its extreme in the Oráculo Manual y Arte de Prudencia (literally Manual Oracle and Art of Discretion, commonly translated as The Art of Worldly Wisdom), which is almost entirely composed of three hundred maxims with commentary. He constantly plays with words: each phrase becomes a puzzle, using the most diverse rhetorical devices. Its appeal has endured: in 1992, Christopher Maurer's translation of this book remained 18 weeks (2 weeks in first place) in The Washington Post's list of Nonfiction General Best Sellers. It has sold nearly 200,000 copies. Critical reception The 1911 Encyclopædia Britannica wrote of Gracián that: ""He has been excessively praised by Schopenhauer, whose appreciation of the author induced him to translate the Oráculo manual, and he has been unduly depreciated by Ticknor and others. He is an acute thinker and observer, misled by his systematic misanthropy and by his fantastic literary theories"".Nietzsche wrote of the Oráculo, ""Europe has never produced anything finer or more complicated in matters of moral subtlety,"" and Schopenhauer, who translated it into German, considered the book ""Absolutely unique... a book made for constant use... a companion for life"" for ""those who wish to prosper in the great world."" A translation of the Oráculo manual from the Spanish by Joseph Jacobs (London: Macmillan and Co., Limited), first published in 1892, was a huge commercial success, with many reprintings over the years (most recently by Shambala). Jacobs's translation is alleged to have been read by Winston Churchill, seven years later, on the ship taking him to the Boer Wars. In Paris, in 1924, a revision and reprint of the translation into French by Abraham Nicolas Amelot de La Houssaye, with a preface by André Rouveyre, attracted a wide readership there, and was admired by André Gide. A new translation by Christopher Maurer (New York: Doubleday) became a national bestseller in the U.S. in 1992 [1], and the English edition, which sold almost 200,000 copies, was translated into Finnish, Chinese, Japanese, Portuguese, and many other languages. Works El Héroe (1637, The Hero), a criticism of Machiavelli, drawing a portrait of the ideal Christian leader. El Político Don Fernando el Católico (1640, The Politician King Ferdinand the Catholic), presents his ideal image of the politician. Arte de Ingenio (1642, revised as Agudeza y Arte de Ingenio in 1648), an essay on literature and aesthetics. El Discreto (1646), describes the qualities which make a man sophisticated and complete. Translated as El Discreto: The Complete Man (1646) by M. San Pedro, release date May 2023. Oráculo Manual y Arte de Prudencia (1647), translated as The Art of Worldly Wisdom (by Joseph Jacobs, 1892), The Oracle, a Manual of the Art of Discretion (by L.B. Walton), Practical Wisdom for Perilous Times (in selections by J. Leonard Kaye), or The Science of Success and the Art of Prudence, his most famous book, some 300 aphorisms with comments. El Criticón (1651–1657), a novel, translated first part as The Critic by Sir Paul Rycaut in 1681.The only publication which bears Gracián's name is El Comulgatorio (1655); his more important books were issued under the pseudonym of Lorenzo Gracián (a supposed brother of the writer) or under the anagram of Gracía de Marlones. Gracián was punished for publishing without his superior's permission El Criticón (in which Defoe is alleged to have found the germ of Robinson Crusoe), but no objection was taken to its substance.

Lee Youn-taek,Korean writers,Writers,"Lee Youn-taek (Korean: 이윤택) is a poet, dramatist, and producer. Life Lee Youn-taek was born July 9, 1952 in South Korea. A poet, dramatist and producer, Lee debuted in 1979 with Jack-O-Lantern (Dokkaebi bul) which appeared in the magazine Contemporary Poetry. As the 1970s ended Lee worked as a reporter for Busan Daily while also focusing on writing and staging plays. In 1986, Lee formed his own theatrical company called Yeonhuidan georipae in Busan and since that time has traveled around the country staging plays. Work According to the Korea Literature Translation Institute: Lee has proved his talents many times over through his production of movie scenarios, TV drama scripts, dance and musical stagings, and theatrical programs for international events. He is not only able to span a broad range of artistic forms, but also brings something new and experimental to each project he undertakes. He injects Korean sentiment and unique humor into his art forms, and is thus widely known as a ""cultural guerilla"". While Lee's themes generally contain something of the dark and serious, his stages teem with a vibrant energy. His plays contemplate and investigate human ""lives"" inching their way to their mortality. Even after a hearty laugh, the audience is always left with much to reflect on. Lee has been active as a director at the National Theatre, where he directed a musical version of Shakespeare's The Tempest in 1999. His production of a musical entitled Dreaming at Hwaseong (Hwaseong-eseo ggum ggunda) performed at world cultural heritage sites, is but one of his many continuing theatrical experimentations. His movies have included: 2003 Ogu (writer and director) 1997 Model (TV Series) 1991 Seoul Evita 1990 Danji geudaega yeojalaneun iyumaneulo Controversy On February 13, 2018, several women, including former actress Kim Soo-hee and actress Hong Seon-joo, accused Lee Youn-taek of sexual harassment. Lee allegedly forced many women in his theater troupe, for 18 years, to massage his genital area prior to raping them. In addition, Kim Soo-hee stated that in 2005, Lee raped her and got her pregnant, for which she had an abortion. Moreover, actress Hong Seon-joo alleged that Lee forcibly penetrated her private part with sticks and wooden chopsticks, saying it will help her vocalization. As a result, Lee resigned from all his positions in the theater world and formally apologized to the victims.

Cecil Willett Cunnington,British writers,Writers,"Cecil Willett Cunnington (22 November 1878 – 21 January 1961) was an English medical doctor and collector, writer and historian on costume and fashion. When he died The Times called him the Leading Authority on English Costume. He and his wife Phillis Emily Cunnington (1887–1974) worked together not only in their medical practice but also on their collection and writing. In 1947 the Cunningtons' extensive costume collection was acquired by the Manchester City Art Gallery and the Gallery of Costume at Platt Hall was opened. Early life Cunnington was born in 1878 in Devizes, Wiltshire, the son of Annette Wright née Leach (1848–1919) and Henry Alfred Cunnington (1850–1879), a wine merchant, and was educated at Clifton College and Cambridge. He later moved to St Bartholomew's Hospital to train as a Physician. War and marriage During World War I Cunnington served as a captain in the Royal Army Medical Corps. In 1918 he married Phillis Webb who was also a qualified doctor and for a number of years they had a joint practice in Finchley. Costume and fashion Cunnington and his wife collected clothes, and they soon had to build a large shed in the garden to house them all. By the end of the 1930s, they had about a thousand costumes, some of which they loaned out for some of the first British television transmissions.Using his collection as a source, Cunnington published his first work, English Women's Clothing in the Nineteenth Century, in 1937. Although his second major work English Women's Clothing in the Present Century did not follow for 15 years he wrote a number of smaller works on the social implications and psychology of fashion. In collaboration with his wife he produced, A History of Underclothes, one of only a few studies on the subject at that time.When they retired, they sold the collection to the Manchester Art Gallery for display at the Gallery of Costume at Platt Hall. Having moved to West Mersea, Essex the couple began a series of five handbooks that covered the history of English dress which they completed by 1959.Cunnington died at his home at West Mersea on 21 January 1961 aged 82. Museum of Clothes In a letter to The Times in November 1937 Cunnington suggested a national costume museum. He also suggested that he would donate his collection to the nation if such a museum was established, if a museum was not established he would offer his collection for sale as he wanted it to remain together rather than being, as he said, ""scattered here and there in existing museums"".In 1945 the collection was offered for sale for £7,000 with the hope that a single benefactor would keep it together. The collection was said to contain over 900 dresses, 650 hats or bonnets, 550 items of underclothing, 100 pairs of shoes, 90 shawls, 100 parasols and 350 examples of ribbons. The collection also included 1,200 bound and 2,600 unbound publications and 15,000 photographs.In 1945 Lawrence Haward, the director of the Manchester City Art Gallery, launched a campaign to raise funds for the purchase of the Cunnigtons' extensive collection. In 1947 the collection was acquired and the Gallery of Costume at Platt Hall was opened. Cunnington served as an honorary advisor to the collection. Selected publications Cunnington, Cecil Willett.

Ebrahim Hussein,Tanzanian writers,Writers,"Ebrahim Hussein (born 1943) is a Tanzanian playwright and poet. His first play, Kinjeketile (1969), written in Swahili, and based on the life of Kinjikitile Ngwale, a leader of the Maji Maji Rebellion, is considered ""a landmark of Tanzanian theater."" The play soon became one of the standard subjects for exams in Swahili language in Tanzania and Kenya. By 1981, it had been reprinted six times. Other plays written by Hussein include Mashetani (1971), an overtly political play, Jogoo Kijijini (1976), an experiment in dramatic performance, and Arusi (1980), in which Hussein expresses disillusionment with the Tanzanian political theory Ujamaa. Short plays of his include Wakati Ukuta (1967). Works and importance for Swahili theatre Hussein was educated at the Aga Khan Secondary School in Dar es Salaam and at the University of Eastern Africa's campus in the same city, where he studied French literature and Theatre Arts. There he wrote some of his first short plays, such as Wakati Ukuta (Time is a Wall) and Alikiona - Consequences. These early works often focus on tensions between the old and new generations and the tensions resulting from European colonialism. Although he accepted elements of the European notions of a ""well-made play"" in the tradition of Aristotle, like the picture-frame stage, he was also interested in traditional African forms of theatre and expectations of the audience. Some of his early plays, like Alikiona, incorporate elements of kichekesho, which is a comical interlude found in the middle of many taarab performances.During the early 1970s, Hussein studied at the Humboldt University in East Berlin and wrote his PhD dissertation ""On the development of theatre in East Africa"". Starting with Kinjeketile, he also employed elements of epic theatre as developed by German playwright Bertold Brecht. Later, he published Jogoo Kijini and Ngao ya Jadi, two texts for a single actor, where he used Swahili traditions of storytelling (hadithi). Therefore, his plays have been characterized as a ""dramaturgy [that] appears to fuse or blend received European models of an intimate theatre with non-Aristotelian and entirely unique techniques of his own.""In his study on Hussein's importance for Swahili theatre, French scholar of African literature Alain Ricard wrote: ""Ebrahim Hussein is the best known Swahili playwright, and Tanzania's most complex literary personality. Known first and foremost as a dramatist, he is also a theorist whose dissertation on the theatre in Tanzania remains the standard reference work. His plays are a corpus of theatrical material with great significance to an understanding of Tanzania's political and social development in relation to the Swahili/Islamic coastal culture, of which he is a part."" List of works Ngao ya Jadi - The Shield of Tradition Hussein's text for one actor Ngao ya Judi has been summarized as follows: Sesota, a serpent, terrorizes a village, so a young peasant is called upon to defeat Sesota. The peasant succeeds and the village rejoices. Over time, the evil the serpent brought grows again, causing the village to become more and more depraved. Eventually, Sesota returns, with no one to challenge him. This text is a retelling of a Swahili folk story in which Sesota is defeated by being trapped in a pot rather than killed and eventually returns. In Hussein's version, Sesota represents colonialism that the ""peasant"" desperately tries to fight. Hussein speaks about how the remnants of colonialism still remain and that any amount of Western influence on African culture brings back that evil. Through this, the retelling also shows that there's no ""good vs. evil"" like in traditional stories, but that the world is rather morally grey. One significant moment is when the village is celebrating after Sesota's death; names of a variety of famous African writers and artists are listed. Here, Hussein seems to be criticizing his fellow artists, saying that their work only comes during moments of joy, rather than being used to combat oppression. Ebrahim Hussein's thesis While Hussein focused on research at the Humboldt University in East Berlin for his PhD thesis from 1970 to 1973, the first scholarly study of his work, Drama and National Culture: a Marxist Study of Ebrahim Hussein by Robert Philipson was published in 1989. Hussein wanted to develop Swahili literature that regarded the crisis of East Africa, specifically in the 1970s. At a conference on the meta-languages of literary studies, he published a study on Greek philosopher Aristotle (1980). Many of his colleagues began studies on his oeuvre after this publication, which focused on Kenyan and Tanzanian literary criticism expressed in Kiswahili. Ebrahim Hussein Poetry Prize The Ebrahim Hussein Poetry prize is an honor awarded annually since 2014 to the winner of the poetry contest under the same name. The contest was created by Safarani Seushi as per wish of the late Canadian filmmaker Gerald Belkin (1940-2012). Belkin was in the process of creating this award, to be named after ""his friend and renowned filmmaker and playwright, Professor Ebrahim Hussein"", when he died. Belkin's goal in establishing this award and prize fund was to foster the careers of Swahili literary authors. The selected poems were published as Diwani ya tunzo ya ushairi ya Ebrahim Hussein (Anthology of Ebrahim Hussein Poetry Prize), in 2017. Ebrahim Hussein Fellowship The Ebrahim Hussein Endowment for research in African expressive cultures was established in the College of Letters and Science at the University of Wisconsin-Madison in 2003, thanks to the generosity of Robert M. Philipson, alumnus of the College of Letters and Science (PhD’89). The College awards up to $7500 each year to one or more full-time graduate students in L&S to carry out research on African expressive cultures and/or archives outside of the United States. Recent winners of the fellowship include Vincent Ogoti, a Kenyan playwright. References Further reading Lihamba, Amandina (1992). ""Popular theatre in Africa"". Voices from Africa. (4): 53–64.

He has repeatedly called and pressured the Afghan government for fighting corruption and he looks at corruption as a major problem for the country. For his contribution to transparency, justice, peace and security of Afghanistan, he was nominated for 2013 Nobel Peace Prize by Combined Joint Interagency Task Force-Shafafiyat (NATO Transparency Task Forces). Afghanistan's affairs Hamdam is closely following Afghanistan and regional countries' developments. Following Afghanistan's affairs as an observer, He has attended International Conference on Afghanistan, The Hague 2009 in the Netherlands, NATO 60 Summit in Strasburg and Kehl, France in 2009, Kabul International conference in 2010, NATO Summit in Lisbon Portugal in 2010, 2nd International Bonn Conference about Afghanistan, the NATO Chicago Summit in 2011 and tens of other national and international conferences on Afghanistan.

Among other Afghan leaders and activists, he also signed the letter to President Obama advocating for the BSA and the letter said: We strongly echo the endorsement of the Bilateral Security Agreement last month at the Loya Jirga and reiterate that the agreement should be signed without delay. Our voice reflects a growing chorus from all segments of Afghan society, including our religious and business community leaders, who remain concerned about the future of our country and wish to see the expeditious finalization of the BSA. Representing Afghanistan in the European Parliament, he advocates for peace, accountability, transparency and fighting corruption. He urged the leadership of the European Union, European Parliament and European Commission to support Afghans in the fight against corruption. He wrote in one of his articles to E.U. leaders: Afghanistan alone cannot reach its goal of reducing corruption; it requires the support of the international community. Without delay, serious actions should be taken to eliminate the problem. These actions should include empowering civil society organizations and the media to play a bigger role in the fight against corruption. If Afghanistan is to qualify for aid over the coming years, seriousness, strong commitment, political determination, and practical decisions will be needed in order to implement the laws and strategies required to overcome the problem of corruption in Afghanistan. Hamdam was often criticized for his pro-Western opinions by some Afghan politicians and some anti-Western figures. He is seen as pro-West. As a Senior NATO Public Diplomacy Adviser, he has often defended NATO policies and by extremists, he is seen as a NATO-backed activist. Hamdam has defended many occasions NATO's positions and he has advocated for Afghanistan to become a NATO member. He was widely criticized by Muslim extremists and regional actors for his article, where he clearly stated that Afghanistan should be a NATO member. After completion of ISAF mission, he advised in one of his articles that ""Afghan government and NATO should be able to enter a new, comprehensive, closer, stronger and mutual relationship. It should be based on mutual commitment and long-term cooperation with full respect for the sovereignty of Afghanistan. The relation which can possibly make Afghanistan a NATO member country in the future."" While some analysts called the ISAF mission as a failure, but Hamdam called that a historic and major success. As a writer He writes for The Huffington Post and many leading Afghan papers and journals on political, security and foreign affairs. Talking about the corruption related issues and Afghanistan's affairs he has been appearing in numbers of national and International media outlets, such as Tolo News TV, Khaama Press News Agency, RFE/RL, BBC, CBS, AFP, ARD, VOA, TRT TV, Aljazeera TV, The Washington Post and other key national and international media outlets. He is optimistic about Afghanistan. After the end of one decade ISAF mission in Afghanistan, he wrote on the Khaama Press that Afghanistan of 2001 is not comparable with Afghanistan of 2015. With 352,000 strong Afghan National Security Forces, backed by the U.S. and NATO, an increasingly vibrant civil society sector, and a large youth population, Afghans are hopeful that their country will never return to the dark era. For this to remain effective, Afghanistan and its partners must continue to broaden those achievements over the next decade, ushering in a new era of transformation. Hamdam looks at democracy as a new phenomenon in Afghanistan and emphasizes on reform and fighting corruption. He wrote in Unipath is a professional military magazine published quarterly by the Commander of the United States Central Command as an international forum for military personnel in the Middle East and Central Asia region: Governments and institutions work differently in democratic societies. He claims that it is not only fighting terrorism and extremists, but good governance that is a key priority for Afghanistan. He sees the weak rule of law and the existence of ""impunity circles"" and safe havens for corrupt individuals and officials in Afghanistan and abroad as the main contributor to violations of human rights and injustice. He believes that the Afghan and U.S. government were not able to define their relationship for more than a decade. Hamdam wrote in his opinion editorial, A Decade of Relations Without Definition, that the Afghan-U.S. relationship should not be only based on dying and killing for each other, but it should be based on social, economic and political interests as well. Numerous opportunities already exist to build that long-term and stable relationship. At the moment, some Afghans see the presence of the U.S. in Afghanistan as a world policing and a force against Al-Qaeda and the Taliban. Hamdam is advocating for peace in Afghanistan and he believes that only military means the war in Afghanistan can not end. However, the Taliban repeatedly asked for the full U.S. troops withdrawal, but Hamdam wants the U.S. and NATO long term presence in Afghanistan.

month at the Loya Jirga and reiterate that the agreement should be signed without delay.', 'Our voice reflects a growing chorus from all segments of Afghan society, including our religious and business community leaders, who remain concerned about the future of our country and wish to see the expeditious finalization of the BSA.', 'Representing Afghanistan in the European Parliament, he advocates for peace, accountability, transparency and fighting corruption.', 'He urged the leadership of the European Union, European Parliament and European Commission to support Afghans in the fight against corruption.', 'He wrote in one of his articles to E.U. leaders: Afghanistan alone cannot reach its goal of reducing corruption; it requires the support of the international community.', 'Without delay, serious actions should be taken to eliminate the problem.', 'These actions should include empowering civil society organizations and the media to play a bigger role in the fight against corruption.', 'If Afghanistan is to qualify for aid over the coming years, seriousness, strong commitment, political determination, and practical decisions will be needed in order to implement the laws and strategies required to overcome the problem of corruption in Afghanistan.', 'Hamdam was often criticized for his pro-Western opinions by some Afghan politicians and some anti-Western figures.', 'He is seen as pro-West.', 'As a Senior NATO Public Diplomacy Adviser, he has often defended NATO policies and by extremists, he is seen as a NATO-backed activist.', ""Hamdam has defended many occasions NATO's positions"", 'and he has advocated for Afghanistan to become a NATO member.', 'He was widely criticized by Muslim extremists and regional actors for his article, where he clearly stated that Afghanistan should be a NATO member.', 'After completion of ISAF mission, he advised in one of his articles that ""Afghan government and NATO should be able to enter a new, comprehensive, closer, stronger and mutual relationship.', 'It should be based on mutual commitment and long-term cooperation with full respect for the sovereignty of Afghanistan.', 'The relation which can possibly make Afghanistan a NATO member country in the future.""', 'While some analysts called the ISAF mission as a failure, but Hamdam called that a historic and major success.', 'As a writer He writes for The Huffington Post and many leading Afghan papers and journals on political, security and foreign affairs.', ""Talking about the corruption related issues and Afghanistan's affairs he has been appearing in numbers of national and International media outlets, such as Tolo News TV, Khaama Press News Agency, RFE/RL, BBC, CBS, AFP, ARD, VOA, TRT TV, Aljazeera TV, The Washington Post and other key national and international media outlets."", 'He is optimistic about Afghanistan.', 'After the end of one decade ISAF mission in Afghanistan, he wrote on the Khaama Press that Afghanistan of 2001 is not comparable with Afghanistan of 2015.', 'With 352,000 strong Afghan National Security Forces, backed by the U.S. and NATO, an increasingly vibrant civil society sector, and a large youth population, Afghans are hopeful that their country will never return to the dark era.', 'For this to remain effective, Afghanistan and its partners must continue to broaden those achievements over the next decade, ushering in a new era of transformation.', 'Hamdam looks at democracy as a new phenomenon in Afghanistan and emphasizes on reform and fighting corruption.', 'He wrote in Unipath is a professional military magazine published quarterly by the Commander of the United States Central Command as an international forum for military personnel in the Middle East and Central Asia region: Governments and institutions work differently in democratic societies.', 'He claims that it is not only fighting terrorism and extremists, but good governance that is a key priority for Afghanistan.', 'He sees the weak rule of law and the existence of ""impunity circles"" and safe havens for corrupt individuals and officials in Afghanistan and abroad as the main contributor to violations of human rights and injustice.', 'He believes that the Afghan and U.S. government were not able to define their relationship for more than a decade.', 'Hamdam wrote in his opinion editorial, A Decade of Relations Without Definition, that the Afghan-U.S. relationship should not be only based on dying and killing for each other, but it should be based on social, economic and political interests as well.', 'Numerous opportunities already exist to build that long-term and stable relationship.', 'At the moment, some Afghans see the presence of the U.S. in Afghanistan as a world policing and a force against Al-Qaeda and the Taliban.', 'Hamdam is advocating for peace in Afghanistan and he believes that only military means the war in Afghanistan can not end.', 'However, the Taliban repeatedly asked for the full U.S. troops withdrawal, but Hamdam wants the U.S. and NATO long term presence in Afghanistan.', 'References']",82,"[['mohammad', 'shafiq', 'hamdam', 'pashto', 'ډاکټر', 'محمد',

Early life He was born in Tbilisi to a Polish father, Michał Zdaniewicz, who taught French in a gymnasium and a Georgian mother, Valentina Gamkrelidze, who was a pianist and student of Tchaikovsky. (His older brother Kiril Zdanevich also became an artist.) He studied in the Faculty of Law of Saint Petersburg State University. In 1912 he and his brother, along with their friend Mikhail Le-Dantyu, became enthusiastic about the Tbilisi painter Niko Pirosmanashvili; Ilya's article about him, ""Khudozhnik-samorodok"" (""A natural-born artist""), his first publication, appeared in the February 13, 1913, issue of Zakavkazskaia Rech'. Later in 1913 he published a monograph Natalia Goncharova, Mikhail Larionov under the pseudonym Eli Eganbyuri (Russian: Эли Эганбюри). In June 1914 the journal Vostok published his article ""Niko Pirosmanashvili,"" in which he mythologized the biography of the older artist, linking him with the Silver Age and the Russian avant-garde. He became involved with the new Futurist movement, participating in their discussions and writing about them and Marinetti in the Russian press, and was drawn to other avant-garde movements as well, such as Zaum and dadaism. During World War I Zdanevich returned to the Caucasus as a newspaper correspondent, and from 1917 to 1919 he lived in Tbilisi, where he published several collections of poetry in the zaum style (Yanko Krul Albansky, Ostraf Paskhi, and Zga Yakaby). In 1918, he joined Aleksei Kruchenykh and others in the Futurist group ""41°."" Zdanevich in 1919 adopted the pseudonym Iliazd. He left Tiflis for Batumi. Paris In October 1920 left the country to investigate the new artistic currents of France. After a year spent in Constantinople acquiring a French visa, he arrived in Paris in October 1921, where together with other artists he organized the group Cherez (""Across""), whose aim was to bring Russian émigrés together with representatives of French culture. In 1923 he began his novel Parizhachi, about four couples who agree to dine together in the Bois de Boulogne; in the course of two and a half hours (each chapter has an exact time for a title, from 11.51 to 14.09) they all manage to betray each other, and the novel itself breaks all manner of orthographic, punctuational, and compositional rules. Zdanevich continued working on this ""hyperformalist"" novel (which he described as an opis', or ""inventory"") until 1926, but it was not published until 1994. His second novel, Voskhishchenie (""Rapture""), was published in a small edition in 1930 and was ignored at the time. Set in a mythical Georgia among mountaineers, on the surface a crime novel, it is actually a fictionalized history of the Russian avant-garde, full of allusions to world literature; it could be said to anticipate magic realism. The language of the novel is innovative and poetic, and the Slavist Milivoje Jovanović called it ""undoubtedly the summit toward which the Russian avant-garde was striving.""Zdanevich's 1923 poster for his and Tristan Tzara's Soirée du coeur à barbe [Evening of the bearded heart] is a widely known example of avant-garde typography and graphic design. During the last forty years of his life in Paris, Zdanevich was active in a variety of areas. He did analyses of church elevations, created fabrics for Chanel, and above all dedicated himself to the creation of artist's books with the collaboration of Picasso, Max Ernst, Miro, and others, and which he published under the imprint ""Le Degré 41"", or ""Le Degré Quarante et Un"" (English, ""The 41st Degree""). His innovative typographic and design work has been exhibited at the New York Public Library, MOMA, in Montreal, in Tbilisi in 1989 in a joint exhibition with his brother Kiril, and in many other venues. Catalogs for many of these exhibitions exist and contain considerably more detailed information about his life and works. Ilia Zdanevich died on Christmas Day 1975 in Paris. He was buried at the Georgian émigré cemetery at Leuville-sur-Orge. References Further reading Iliazd and the Illustrated Book. Museum of Modern Art, New York, 1987.

He has criticized the monarchy in columns in the foreign press in the past and once ran a center that held meetings that included opposition groups.In 2015, Monjib was brought to justice along with six other journalists and activists in Morocco, and charged with ""threatening national security"", before being banned from traveling outside the country, in a case that was widely criticised by human rights groups and was considered as politically motivated. Since then, the trial has been postponed 15 times.On 29 December 2020, Monjib was arrested in Rabat for ""money laundering and fraud"". The accusations from the Moroccan authorities claimed misuse of funds he received from international NGOs, even if the latter never expressed any doubt as to how the funds were used.

Leymah Gbowee,Liberian writers,Writers,"Leymah Roberta Gbowee (born 1 February 1972) is a Liberian peace activist responsible for leading a women's nonviolent peace movement, Women of Liberia Mass Action for Peace that helped bring an end to the Second Liberian Civil War in 2003. Her efforts to end the war, along with her collaborator Ellen Johnson Sirleaf, helped usher in a period of peace and enabled a free election in 2005 that Sirleaf won. Gbowee and Sirleaf, along with Tawakkul Karman, were awarded the 2011 Nobel Peace Prize ""for their non-violent struggle for the safety of women and for women's rights to full participation in peace-building work."" Early life Leymah Gbowee was born in central Liberia on 1 February 1972. At the age of 17, she was living with her parents and two of her three sisters in Monrovia, when the First Liberian Civil War erupted in 1989, throwing the country into chaos until 1996.: 15–25, 50  ""As the war subsided she learned about a program run by UNICEF,... training people to be social workers who would then counsel those traumatized by war,"" wrote Gbowee in her 2011 memoir, Mighty Be Our Powers.: 50  She did a three-month training, which led her to be aware of her own abuse at the hands of the father of her two young children, son Joshua ""Nuku"" and daughter Amber.: 50  Searching for peace and sustenance for her family, Gbowee followed her partner, called Daniel in her memoir, to Ghana where she and her growing family (her second son, Arthur, was born) lived as virtually homeless refugees and almost starved.: 59–68  She fled with her three children, riding a bus on credit for over a week ""because I didn't have a cent,"" back to the chaos of Liberia, where her parents and other family members still lived.: 69 In 1998, in an effort to gain admission to an associate of arts degree program in social work at Mother Patern College of Health Sciences, Gbowee became a volunteer within a program of the Lutheran Church in Liberia operating out of St. Peter's Lutheran Church in Monrovia, where her mother was a women's leader and Gbowee had passed her teenage years. It was called the Trauma Healing and Reconciliation Program (THRP), and it marked the beginning of Gbowee's journey toward being a peace activist:: 80–82 The THRP's offices were new, but the program had a history. Liberia's churches had been active in peace efforts ever since the civil war started, and in 1991, Lutheran pastors, lay leaders, teachers and health workers joined with the Christian Health Association of Liberia to try to repair the psychic and social damage left by the war.: 81  Gbowee studied and worked her way toward her associate of art degree, conferred in 2001,: 111  while applying her training in trauma healing and reconciliation to try to rehabilitate some of the ex-child soldiers of Charles Taylor's army. Surrounded by the images of war, she realized that ""if any changes were to be made in society it had to be by the mothers"". Gbowee gave birth to a second daughter Nicole ""Pudu"", making her the mother of four, as she engaged in the next chapter of her life's journey – rallying the women of Liberia to stop the violence that was destroying their children. Education and training Gbowee obtained an Associate of Arts degree in social work (2001) from Mother Patern College of Health Sciences in Monrovia, Liberia, and subsequently graduated with a Master of Arts in Conflict Transformation (2007) from Eastern Mennonite University in Harrisonburg, Virginia. She also received a certificate in Conflict Prevention and Peacebuilding Training from the United Nations Institute for Training, the Healing Victims of War Trauma Center in Cameroon, and Non-Violent Peace Education in Liberia Career Gbowee is the founder and president of Gbowee Peace Foundation Africa, founded in 2012 and based in Monrovia, which provides educational and leadership opportunities to girls, women and the youth in Liberia. In addition, Gbowee is the former executive director of the Women Peace and Security Network Africa, based in Accra, Ghana, which builds relationships across the West African sub-region in support of women's capacity to prevent, avert, and end conflicts. She is a founding member and former coordinator of the Women in Peacebuilding Program/West African Network for Peacebuilding (WIPNET/WANEP). She also served as the commissioner-designate for the Liberia Truth and Reconciliation Commission. For the 2013–2015 academic years, she was a Distinguished Fellow in Social Justice at Barnard College of Columbia University. In 2013, she became an Oxfam Global Ambassador.Gbowee speaks internationally to advance women's rights, and peace and security. In 2016, Gbowee spoke at a protest march organized by Women Wage Peace, a political grassroots group working to advance a peace agreement between Israel and Palestine.Gbowee is also an outspoken supporter of fellow Liberian Ebenezer Norman's non-profit organization A New Dimension of Hope, a foundation which builds schools in Liberia. In May 2015, she wrote personal letters to the contributors of NDhope's crowd-funding campaign on Indiegogo and has spoken at their events.As of April 2017, Gbowee is also Executive Director of the Women of Peace and Security Program at AC4, Earth Institute, Columbia University.Gbowee is also a contributor at The Daily Beast. Involvement in trauma healing In the spring of 1999, after Gbowee had been at the Trauma Healing project for a year,: 95  her supervisor, Reverend Bartholomew Bioh ""BB"" Colley, a pastor of the Lutheran Church in Liberia, introduced her to Samuel Gbaydee Doe (no relation to the former Liberian president by the same first and last name),: 98  a ""passionate and intelligent"": 107  Liberian who had just earned a master's degree from a Christian university in the U.S. that specialized in peace-building studies. Doe was the executive director of Africa's first regional peace organization, the West Africa Network for Peacebuilding (WANEP), which he had co-founded in 1998 in Ghana. Encouraged by the Lutheran reverend she calls ""BB"", Gbowee began reading widely in the field of peacebuilding, notably reading The Politics of Jesus by Mennonite theologian John Howard Yoder, and works by ""Martin Luther King Jr. and Gandhi and the Kenyan author and conflict and reconciliation expert Hizkias Assefa."": 88 By late 1999, ""WANEP was actively seeking to involve women in its work and I was invited to a conference in Ghana,"" wrote Gbowee.: 101  At a follow-up WANEP conference in October 2000, Gbowee met Thelma Ekiyor of Nigeria, who was ""well educated, a lawyer who specialized in alternative dispute resolution."": 107–108  Ekiyor told Gbowee of her idea of approaching WANEP to start a women's organization. ""Thelma was a thinker, a visionary, like BB and Sam. But she was a woman, like me."": 109 Within a year, Ekiyor had secured funding from WANEP and had organized the first meeting of the Women in Peacebuilding Network (WIPNET) in Accra, Ghana, which Gbowee attended: How to describe the excitement of that first meeting...? There were women from Sierra Leone, Guinea, Nigeria, Senegal, Burkina Faso, Togo – almost all the sixteen West African nations. In her quietly brilliant way, Thelma had handwritten an organizer's training manual with exercises that would draw women out, engage them, teach them about conflict and conflict resolution, and even help them understand why they should be involved in addressing these issues at all.: 112  In the sympathetic setting of other women hungry for peace, Gbowee told the painful parts of her life story for the first time, including sleeping on the floor of a hospital corridor with her newborn baby for a week because she had no money to pay the bill and nobody to help her.: 113  ""No one else in Africa was doing this: focusing only on women and only on building peace."": 113  Ekiyor became Gbowee's trainer and friend. She also was the one who announced the launch of WIPNET in Liberia and named Gbowee as coordinator of Liberian Women's Initiative.: 114–115  Gbowee's ""peace-church"" philosophical orientation likely can be traced to this era – Thelma Ekiyor, Rev. ""BB"" Colley, Samuel Gbaydee Doe, and Hizkias Assefa are all connected to Eastern Mennonite University in the United States, either as former students or (in Assefa's case) as an ongoing professor. Leading a mass women's movement In the spring of 2002, Gbowee was spending her days employed in trauma-healing work and her evenings as the unpaid leader of WIPNET in Liberia. Her children, now including an adopted daughter named Lucia ""Malou"" (bringing the number of children to five), were living in Ghana under her sister's care.: 148  Falling asleep in the WIPNET office one night, she awoke from a dream where she says God had told her, ""Gather the women and pray for peace!"": 122  Some friends helped her to understand that the dream was not meant for others, as Gbowee thought; instead, she realized that it was a necessary for her to act upon it herself.: 122 Following a WIPNET training session in Liberia,: 124  Gbowee and her allies, including a Mandingo-Muslim woman named Asatu, began by ""going to the mosques on Friday at noon after prayers, to the markets on Saturday morning, to two churches every Sunday."": 126  Their flyers read: ""We are tired! We are tired of our children being killed! We are tired of being abused!! Women, wake up – you have a voice in the peace process!"" They also handed out simple drawings explaining their purpose to the many women who couldn't read.: 127 By the summer of 2002, Gbowee was recognized as the spokeswoman and inspirational leader of the Women of Liberia Mass Action for Peace, described as a peace movement that started with local women praying and singing in a fish market. Working across religious and ethnic lines, Gbowee led thousands of Christian and Muslim women to gather in Monrovia for months. They prayed for peace, using Muslim and Christian prayers, and eventually held daily nonviolent demonstrations and sit-ins in defiance of orders from the tyrannical president at that time, Charles Taylor.: 128, 135 They staged protests that included the threat of a curse and a sex strike. Of the strike, Gbowee says, ""The [sex] strike lasted, on and off, for a few months. It had little or no practical effect, but it was extremely valuable in getting us media attention."": 147  In a highly risky move, the women finally occupied a field that had been used for soccer; it was beside Tubman Boulevard, the route Charles Taylor traveled twice a day, to and from Capitol Hill.: 136  To make themselves more recognizable as a group, all of the women wore T-shirts that were white, signifying peace, with the WIPNET logo and white hair ties.: 136  Taylor finally granted a hearing for the women on 23 April 2003. With more than 2,000 women amassed outside his executive mansion, Gbowee was the person designated to make their case to him.: 140  Gbowee positioned her face to be seen by Taylor but directed her words to Grace Minor, the president of the senate and the only female government official present: We are tired of war. We are tired of running. We are tired of begging for bulgur wheat. We are tired of our children being raped. We are now taking this stand, to secure the future of our children. Because we believe, as custodians of society, tomorrow our children will ask us, ""Mama, what was your role during the crisis?"": 141  In her book, Gbowee reveals that Grace Minor quietly ""gave a great deal of her own money... at enormous personal risk"" to the women's protest movement.: 149  The protesting women extracted a promise from President Charles Taylor to attend peace talks in Ghana to negotiate with the rebels from Liberians United for Reconciliation and Democracy and another newer rebel group, MODEL.: 155 In June 2003, Gbowee led a delegation of Liberian women to Ghana to put pressure on the warring factions during the peace-talk process. At first the women sat in a daily demonstration outside the posh hotels where the negotiators met, pressuring for progress in the talks.: 154–156  When the talks dragged from early June through late July, with no progress made and violence continuing in Liberia, Gbowee led dozens of women, eventually swelling to a couple hundred, inside the hotel, where they simply ""dropped down, in front of the glass door that was the main entrance to the meeting room."": 161  They held signs that said: ""Butchers and murderers of the Liberian people -- STOP!"": 161  Gbowee passed a message to the lead mediator, General Abubakar (a former president of Nigeria), that the women would interlock their arms and remain seated in the hallway, holding the delegates ""hostage"" until a peace agreement was reached. Abubakar, who proved to be sympathetic to the women, announced with some amusement: ""The peace hall has been seized by General Leymah and her troops."" When the men tried to leave the hall, Leymah and her allies threatened to rip their clothes off: ""In Africa, it's a terrible curse to see a married or elderly woman deliberately bare herself."": 162  With Abubakar's support, the women remained sitting outside the negotiating room during the following days, ensuring that the ""atmosphere at the peace talks changed from circuslike to somber."": 163 The Liberian war ended officially weeks later, with the signing of the Accra Comprehensive Peace Agreement on 18 August 2003.: 164  ""But what we [women] did marked the beginning of the end."": 163 In addition to helping bring an end to 14 years of warfare in Liberia, this women's movement led to the 2005 election of Ellen Johnson Sirleaf as president of Liberia, the first elected woman leader of a country in Africa. Sirleaf is co-recipient of the 2011 Nobel Peace Prize along with Gbowee and Tawakel Karman. The three were awarded the prize ""for their non-violent struggle for the safety of women and for women's rights to full participation in peace-building work."" In Sirleaf's re-election campaign of 2011, Gbowee endorsed her. Consolidating the peace Recognizable in their white WIPNET T-shirts, Gbowee and the other Liberian women activists were treated as national heroines by Liberians in the streets for weeks following the signing of the Accra Comprehensive Peace Agreement.: 167  Yet Gbowee wrote of their unceasing nervousness about the fragility of the peace they had helped birth: A war of fourteen years doesn't just go away. In the moments we were calm enough to look around, we had to confront the magnitude of what had happened in Liberia. Two hundred and fifty thousand people were dead, a quarter of them children. One in three were displaced, with 350,000 living in internally displaced persons camps and the rest anywhere they could find shelter. One million people, mostly women and children, were at risk of malnutrition, diarrhea, measles and cholera because of contamination in the wells. More than 75 percent of the country's physical infrastructure, our roads, hospitals and schools, had been destroyed.: 167  Gbowee expressed particular concern for the ""psychic damage"" borne by Liberians: A whole generation of young men had no idea who they were without a gun in their hands. Several generations of women were widowed, had been raped, seen their daughters and mothers raped, and their children kill and be killed. Neighbors had turned against neighbors; young people had lost hope, and old people, everything they had painstakingly earned. To a person, we were traumatized.: 168  In an interview for the International Women's Day, Gbowee also expressed: The Liberian women peace movement demonstrated to the world that grassroots movements are essential to sustaining peace; that women in leadership positions are effective brokers for peace; and the importance of culturally relevant social justice movements. Liberia's experience is a good example to the world that women—especially African women—can be drivers of peace Amid the destruction and unending needs, Gbowee was appalled by the arrogance, ignorance and overall cultural insensitivity of the United Nations agencies dispatched to help disarm the country, keep the peace, establish procedures for democratic governance, and initiate rebuilding efforts. ""People who have lived through a terrible conflict may be hungry and desperate, but they're not stupid (Gbowee's emphasis). They often have very good ideas about how peace can evolve, and they need to be asked."": 171  Gbowee advocated for involving Liberian civil society, especially women's organizations, in restoring the country. She grew frustrated with the way the ""UN was spending many millions of dollars in Liberia, but most of it was on [their own] staffing resources.... If they had just given some of that money to the local people, it would have made a real difference."": 173 By the late fall and winter of 2003-04, ""the world of conflict resolution, peace-building and the global women's movement"" was calling Gbowee to write papers, come to conferences and otherwise explain the experience and views of WIPNET. Thelma Ekiyor encouraged Gbowee to overcome her lack of self-esteem among ""highly intelligent people who held master's degrees and represented powerful institutions"" by reading and studying further to understand the theories circulating in the world of peacebuilding.: 177  She read The Peace Book by Louise Diamond, known for advocating multi-track diplomacy, and The Journey Toward Reconciliation and The Little Book of Conflict Transformation, both written by John Paul Lederach, the founding director of the Center for Justice and Peacebuilding at Eastern Mennonite University.: 177  She went to a USAID conference in New York, her first trip out of Africa,: 174–175  to a conference in South Africa, and to Switzerland where she dealt with the Nigerian in charge of UN programs in Liberia.: 174–176 Master's degree in peacebuilding In the late spring of 2004, about eight months after the Ghana-Accra Comprehensive Peace Agreement was signed, Gbowee made a decision to take college-level courses in the field in which she had been working: ""I'd heard about Eastern Mennonite University (EMU), an American college with a well-known program in peace-building and conflict resolution. It was a Christian school that emphasized community and service; it had a long-standing relationship with WANEP and a history of recruiting Africans to study there."": 178  Her first stint at EMU – four weeks at its annual Summer Peacebuilding Institute – were ""a transformative time for me."": 178 Gbowee studied with Hizkias Assefa, whose writings she had read five years earlier when she first began working for St. Peter's Lutheran Church on trauma healing. She also studied with Howard Zehr, ""who taught me the concept of restorative justice,"" whereby healing occurred through the joint efforts of victims and offenders to repair the harms done.: 178  She thought restorative justice was particularly applicable to Africa: ""Restorative justice was...something we could see as ours and not artificially imposed by Westerners. And we needed it, needed that return to tradition. A culture of impunity flourished throughout Africa. People, officials, governments did evil but were never held accountable. More than we needed to punish them, we needed to undo the damage they had done.... When I left EMU, I knew there was more here for me. Somehow I would find a way to come back."": 178–179 Gbowee returned for a round-table called Strategies for Trauma Healing and Resilience in the summer of 2005 and then enrolled as a residential, full-time master's degree student in ""conflict transformation and peacebuilding"" at EMU's Center for Justice and Peacebuilding in 2006-07: At graduate school, I could feel my mind expand, my comprehension deepen. I realized I now could put a formal name, ""strategic peacebuilding,"" to what I'd done instinctively in Liberia.... Many of the other students at EMU had lived through conflict, and there was relief in being among them.... In Harrisonburg, a small old city in the Shenandoah Valley, far from Liberia and its sorrows and people who expected something from me, I didn't have to be strong. Every now and then – for instance, when I saw a mother with her children – I would burst into tears. No one at EMU thought that was strange. I met an old man who'd lost his entire family in the Rwandan genocide.: 179  In September 2006, just as Gbowee was embarking on her first full semester of graduate school, she went to New York City to address the UN on the occasion of the fifth anniversary of the passage of Resolution 1325, which dealt with protecting women from gender-based violence and involving them in UN-linked peace efforts.: 179  While in New York, she received a call from Abigail Disney, a descendant of the founders of the Walt Disney Company, a feminist, and a philanthropist. Disney and a collaborator, Gini Reticker, wanted to talk with Gbowee about their desire to make a documentary about how the women of Liberia rallied themselves to force the men to stop battling.: 212 Women in Peace and Security Network (WIPSEN) During 2006-07 Gbowee also began talking with Ekiyor and Ecoma Alaga (a Nigerian, like Ekiyor) about splitting WIPNET from WANEP, believing the parent organization to be controlled financially by men and wanting the three of them to be fully in charge.: 187  The founding director of WANEP, Gbowee's old friend Sam Gbaydee Doe, was sympathetic to the three women's desire for structural independence, but he had left WANEP to pursue a PhD in England.: 189  WANEP was now led by another graduate of the MA in conflict transformation program at EMU, Emmanuel Bombande of Ghana, who did not agree that the three women owned the WIPNET branch of WANEP and thus would not let it spin off.: 188–189  As a result, Gbowee and her two colleagues started a new organization, Women in Peace and Security Network (WIPSEN), also based in Accra, Ghana."": 189  Abigail Disney stepped up to help Gbowee raise funds for launching WIPSEN among philanthropists in New York, enabling her to secure $50,000 in seed money.: 202 Personal life and struggles By the time Gbowee finished her coursework at EMU on 30 April 2007, and returned to her children in Liberia in May 2007 – where her parents had been caring for them – she realized that her nine months away ""nearly broke all of us."": 194  In Virginia, she had lived with ""a cold that never went away"" and she ""felt panic, sadness, and cold, swirling blackness"" as she faced ""being sued by former friends at WANEP over our desire to move in a new direction."": 200–201  Her impending graduate degree (conferred at the end of 2007), growing fame, and other changes in her life strained the relationship she had with a Liberian man named Tunde, an employee of international agencies who had functioned as a father figure for her children for a decade, from the early period of the Liberian women's peace movement through Gbowee's graduate studies at EMU: 203–204  (for which he had paid the tuition: 198 ). They broke up and by early 2008 Gbowee was in a relationship with a Liberian information technology expert whom she identifies as James.: 205–205  He is the father of her sixth child, a daughter named Jaydyn Thelma Abigail, born in New York City on 2 June 2009.: 223 In April 2008, when Gbowee's family and friends gathered to celebrate the 14th birthday of her eldest daughter, Amber, it was clear that Gbowee had developed a serious alcohol problem. In her memoir, Gbowee explains that she had turned to alcohol for about a decade to cope with the loneliness of constant separations from her family, the strain of poverty and war-engendered trauma she suffered from, and the stress of never-ending demands on her time. During Amber's birthday party, Gbowee's children noted that she drank 14 glasses of wine. The next day, she passed out. When again conscious, suffering from an ulcer, she begged James to take her to the doctor: ""Then I saw the kids gathered around us, their terrified, helpless faces. After all their losses, this would be the final one. No. Not possible. It might sound too easy, but that was the end for me. I still don't sleep easily and I still wake up too early, but I don't drink anymore."": 208–209 Religious views Gbowee, during the Liberian Civil War used religion and spirituality as part of their techniques that helped ended the war. She expressed her usage of religious songs, traditional songs, and other songs that was sung by her women counterparts, Muslim women. After her Nobel Prize winning in 2011, she did multiple interviews, specifying the importance of her inclusion and determination in using religion as the stepping stone for achieving peace in Liberia. On October 6, 2016, Gbowee did an interview with Harvard Divinity Schools, speaking on her topic ""Women as Catalysts for Local and Global Spiritually-Engaged Movements for Sustainable Peace."" Gbowee used religion and spirituality as strategies to rally women for ending Liberia’s two civil wars . Tactics that she used such as religious and traditional songs to help create a bonding community with her women. Throughout her memoir, Mighty Be Our Powers: How Sisterhood, Prayer, and Sex Changed a Nation at War; a Memoir, One can perceive the influence of her religious beliefs on initiatives for restoring peace in Liberia. After the second civil war broke out in 1999, increasing the already existing problem of rape and systematic brutality in Liberia, Gbowee felt the need for an inter-religious call for action. In response to this second wave of deadly conflict, Gbowee formed an inter-religious peace building coalition of Christian and Muslim women, which lead to the uproar of the Liberia Mass Action for Peace Movement. With her involvement in these powerful settings, Gbowee gained a great amount of leadership skills in which she combined with her religious background. During the LMAPM, she along with other women activists, formed multiple pray-ins, using it as a form of nonviolent protest. These pray-ins called for reconciliation and demanded concrete actions to end the war during peace talks around West Africa. Gbowee, along with many other women, such as Thelma Ekiyor, combined religion and traditional practices to define their approach to conflict transformation, peace building, and security.Gbowee’s faith has had a tremendous impact on her personal and professional life. Prayer is a recurrent theme in her memoir and talks. Although her memoir depicts instances of loss, pain, grief, and disappointment that made her question her faith, she indicates that prayer has been an intrinsic part of her journey in peace building. She writes, “God is ever faithful, ever loving; he listens to our prayers.” She used prayer as a source of protection, hope, and guidance in her activist work. Gbowee perceive Christianity to be very self-serving and crucial to the social and cultural realities of the Liberian people . Gbowee believes that for adequate results to be seen in conflict situations, especially the ones in which she was involved in, prayer had to occupy center stage. This is a central characteristic of her identity as a global activist as it is an important part of her work. Being involved in groups such as the Christian Women’s Peace Initiative (CWI), helped her to embody this part of her faith into bringing peace and teaching peace to others over the past year.Religion influenced Gbowee's approach to peace building as a type of mothering. In fact, she engages the often marginalized voices of women and young men who bear the brunt of war. Gbowee has used religion to achieve many of her activist roles throughout her traveling career and teaching in healing spaces. An important role that she and other powerful women such as Ekiyor, used religion as a support tool to mother those who have been traumatized, searching for peace within their communities, their homes, and their country. Praying had always been a part of Gbowee’s life, especially in her romantic life. Using prayer for her was a healing tool that helped her overcome her abusive relationships and protect her children. One aspect of Gbowee using religion and faith as a form of mothering is by using it as a resource to help whoever she is helping feel connected. She used her faith and beliefs, especially the bible to help them understand their shared experiences and trauma. In September 2016, Gbowee did an interview at the Harvard Divinity School on “Religion and The Practice of Peace.” She points out that Religion and spirituality were common aspects in the lives of the women who participated in the Liberian Women’s Mass Action for Peace. These spiritual encounters are what she used in her community to mobilize and empower women to take action in all aspects of their lives, whether personal, spiritual, or political. In the Harvard interview, she states: “In our group the first thing we did was to hold three days of consultative meetings. The first day we brought only Christian women, and we went back into the Bible to find those things in the Bible that women did. We wanted to really show them (Christian women) that God had a way of using women and that there’s a place for women in turning around the history of their nations. So, we took them to the Bible, and we used women of faith as examples—Esther, Deborah, Rahab the Prostitute—who had done great things to turn the tide. We used those women as the springboard for really mobilizing women.”Religion and the bible enabled Gbowee to convey her vision to Liberian women with different creeds. In order to build stronger communities for peace-building and promoting activism included the containment of other religious groups, which is a big part of the Women’s movement’s success. However, for Gbowee, building a stronger community amongst women that will put them at the forefront of such a major movement for the end of wars and not limiting her beliefs to just Christianity, is a tactic she encouraged. In the Harvard interview again, she states that: “The second thing we did was to bring the Muslim women together and go through the same process, but with the Qur’an...We would talk and read some of the descriptions that talk about how to treat women better and live a nonviolent life…”Using faith as a common denominator amongst all women, helped them to create a closer leadership bond. Gbowee came from a mixed religious and spiritual community where her parents were Christians, but their close friends and neighbors were Muslims. Using religion to bring young people together, especially for young girls and women, became a motive and a goal for Gbowee to help breed leadership and women empowerment skills through her activism, creating new leaders for the future. Gbowee had worked in multiple healing spaces, for example, the Trauma Healing Office, where she traveled around Liberia to different communities, trying to educate people on how to deal with their traumas. She felt as if this is her calling from God. Because of the severity of the war and her trying to provide for her family, keeping a strong faith is used to help provide comfort through her work, especially since her target is towards weakened women and young boys who have been a part of the destructive process against their wills. Through her activism work in her communities in Liberia, it is fueled by her experiences at home. She is not able to mother her children the way she wanted, and to her, apart from her children, not losing faith is most important for her. People whom she had helped in both Liberia and Ghana referred to her as being “Big Mama” or “Mother of Peace.”Religion and spirituality for Gbowee are considered essential in the peace coalition and the healing of everyone and everywhere. She believes that to overcome injustices that take over people's livelihood and the way they live their day to day lives, it calls for true believers. Being a religious person in these settings, for Gbowee, revenge is not the way to go. She recounts reading the bible and searching for different accounts that encourage peace and not an “eye for an eye.” For Gbowee, religion and its relevance helps to teach compassion and practice forgiveness which had also contributed to the success of her activism work. Working with angered people who had dealt with social and political trauma, forgiveness became a part of the healing process and education for her intended audiences. To Gbowee, forgiveness does not have a specific religious practice attached to it, but multiple. She mentions at a peace conference that, “In my life’s journey, it hasn’t been just Christians who have reached out to me. It hasn’t been just Muslims. It has been people of different faiths.”In terms of her contributions to the conceptions of violence, Gbowee also used her faith to push emphasis on why non-violence approaches are important. This is especially prominent in the Women’s movement and her involvement while working with the Women in Peace-building Network (WIPNET). The way she used helped break apart the comfortability of violence amongst people who are vulnerable is by using vulnerable people. She used women who are also strong in faith and who have struggles with close contact with acts of violence although all were in a larger sense. Many of the women that were active with Gbowee, faced violence such as sexual, physical, emotional, mental, and physical forces. Traditional religious songs and dances were used in the non-violent, healing, and peace. These dances and songs are used as a form of storytelling. Gbowee expresses devotion to her Christian faith. She opened the acknowledgment section of her memoir with these words: ""All praise, glory and honor to God for His unfailing love and favor toward me."": 245  She told students attending an EMU chapel in 2009: I didn't get there by myself... or anything I did as an individual, but it was by the grace and mercy of God.... He has held my hands. In the most difficult of times, he has been there. They have this song, ""Order my steps in your ways, dear Lord,"" and every day as I wake up, that is my prayer, because there's no way that anyone can take this journey as a peace builder, as an agent of change in your community, without having a sense of faith.... As I continue this journey in this life, I remind myself: All that I am, all that I hope to be, is because of God. Gbowee told the EMU students that she went from being an angry, broke, virtually homeless, 25-year-old mother of four children with no idea of what her future might be, to listening to the voice of God in 1997. She said God spoke to her through a five-year-old boy, a son whom she had nicknamed Nuku. Comments made by Nuku made her realize that she had succumbed to ""crippling hopelessness"", and that her low self-esteem and sense of helplessness were destroying her family, which was already under assault from Liberia's brutal warfare. Gbowee said she began taking one tiny step at a time, asking for God's help with each step. And that God sent her angels in the form of human beings who reached out a hand at just the moment when she was most desperate.As suggested by the interfaith character of the Liberian women's movement, Gbowee noted that others may derive the same support from religious faiths different from hers: It could be Jesus, it could be Mohammed, it could be Buddha, but there is no way that you can effect change in people's lives if there is not someone that you can rely on as the ""divine intervenor"" or the ""divine one"" that you can call on every day.... God is faithful, whoever you know him to me.... Take a step of faith and God will see to the rest. In an interview with Odyssey Networks, Gbowee said that God could also be referred to as a ""Higher Power."" She stressed that with a Higher Power accompanying you, you can ""rise up and do something to change your situation."" She advised: ""Don't wait for a Gandhi, don't wait for a King, don't wait for a Mandela. You are your own Mandela, you are your own Gandhi, you are your own King."" Documentary film Gbowee is the narrator and central character in the 2008 documentary film Pray the Devil Back to Hell, which consists of scores of film and audio clips from the war period. It took Best Documentary Feature in the 2008 Tribeca Film Festival in New York. It has been broadcast across the United States as part of the ""Women, War & Peace"" series, which aired over five successive Tuesdays in October and early November 2011 on public television stations. Pray has been used as an advocacy tool in conflict and post-conflict zones, such as Bosnia, Afghanistan, Iraq, South Africa, Rwanda, Mexico, Kenya, Cambodia, Russia, Sudan, the Democratic Republic of the Congo, and the West Bank: ""The reaction was remarkably similar: no matter how different the country and the society, women recognized themselves and started talking about how they could unite to solve their own problems."": 214 In the documentary, Gbowee emerges as someone able to laugh and enjoy life, despite what she has lived through: ""Gbowee comes across as a sharply strategic, scrappy, political maestro interfaith mobilizer of merriment. Not the balloons-confetti-cupcakes-clown-type fun, but rather solidarity-inspiring conviviality. You see women dancing, singing, smiling, wearing beautiful, white-as-doves clothing, and you even see laughter during sit-ins and protests."" Awards and recognitions Gbowee's exposure to the New York philanthropic social set, facilitated by Disney (who had become a close friend), opened the door for a series of awards. The first, from the John F. Kennedy School of Government at Harvard, came in early 2006, and then they began to arrive in accelerated fashion: recognition by Women's eNews, the Gruber Prize for Women's Rights, the John F. Kennedy Profile in Courage Award, the Living Legends Award for Service to Humanity, and several more. In July 2011, EMU announced that Gbowee had been named its ""Alumna of the Year"". (Gbowee's eldest son, Joshua ""Nuku"" Mensah, entered EMU as a freshman in 2010, overlapping by one year with Sam Gbaydee Doe's eldest daughter, Samfee Doe, then a senior.) The crowning honor came in October 2011 when the Norwegian Nobel Committee made Gbowee one of three female recipients of the 2011 Nobel Peace Prize. In 2022, Gbowee was a Bartels World Affairs Fellows at Cornell University, giving the annual Bartels World Affairs Lecture.

bonding community with her women.', 'Throughout her memoir, Mighty Be Our Powers: How Sisterhood, Prayer, and Sex Changed a Nation at War; a Memoir, One can perceive the influence of her religious beliefs on initiatives for restoring peace in Liberia.', 'After the second civil war broke out in 1999, increasing the already existing problem of rape and systematic brutality in Liberia, Gbowee felt the need for an inter-religious call for action.', 'In response to this second wave of deadly conflict, Gbowee formed an inter-religious peace building coalition of Christian and Muslim women, which lead to the uproar of the Liberia Mass Action for Peace Movement.', 'With her involvement in these powerful settings, Gbowee gained a great amount of leadership skills in which she combined with her religious background.', 'During the LMAPM, she along with other women activists, formed multiple pray-ins, using it as a form of nonviolent protest.', 'These pray-ins called for reconciliation and demanded concrete actions to end the war during peace talks around West Africa.', 'Gbowee, along with many other women, such as Thelma Ekiyor, combined religion and traditional practices to define their approach to conflict transformation, peace building, and security.', 'Gbowee’s faith has had a tremendous impact on her personal and professional life.', 'Prayer is a recurrent theme in her memoir and talks.', 'Although her memoir depicts instances of loss, pain, grief, and disappointment that made her question her faith, she indicates that prayer has been an intrinsic part of her journey in peace building.', 'She writes, “God is ever faithful, ever loving; he listens to our prayers.”', 'She used prayer as a source of protection, hope, and guidance in her activist work.',

situations, especially the ones in which she was involved in, prayer had to occupy center stage.', 'This is a central characteristic of her identity as a global activist as it is an important part of

used religion as a support tool to mother those who have been traumatized, searching for peace within their communities, their homes, and their country.', 'Praying had always been a part of Gbowee’s life, especially in her romantic life.', 'Using prayer for her was a healing tool that helped her overcome her abusive relationships and protect her children.', 'One aspect of Gbowee using religion and faith as a form of mothering is by using it as a resource to help whoever she is helping feel connected.', 'She used her faith and beliefs, especially the bible to help them understand their shared experiences and trauma.', 'In September 2016, Gbowee did an interview at the Harvard Divinity School on “Religion and The Practice of Peace.”', 'She points out that Religion and spirituality were common aspects in the lives of the women who participated in the Liberian Women’s Mass Action for Peace.', 'These spiritual encounters are what she used in her community to mobilize and empower

consultative meetings.', 'The first day we brought only Christian women, and we went back into the Bible to find those things in the Bible that women did.', 'We wanted to really show them (Christian women) that God had a way of using women and that there’s a place for women in turning around the history of their nations.', 'So, we took them to the Bible, and we used women of faith as examples—Esther, Deborah, Rahab the Prostitute—who had done great things to turn the tide.', 'We used those women as the springboard for really mobilizing women.”Religion', 'and the bible enabled Gbowee to convey her vision to Liberian women with different creeds.', 'In order to build stronger communities for peace-building and promoting activism included the containment of other religious groups, which is a big part of the Women’s movement’s success.', 'However, for Gbowee, building a stronger community amongst women that will put them at the forefront of such a major movement for the end of wars and not limiting her beliefs to just Christianity, is a tactic she encouraged.', 'In the Harvard interview again, she states that: “The second thing we did was to bring the Muslim women together and go through the same process, but with the Qur’an...', 'We would talk and read some of the descriptions that talk about how to treat women better and live a nonviolent life…”Using faith as a common denominator amongst all women, helped them to create a closer leadership bond.', 'Gbowee came from a mixed religious and spiritual community where her parents were Christians, but their close friends and neighbors were Muslims.', 'Using religion to bring young people together, especially for young girls and women, became a motive and a goal for Gbowee to help breed leadership and women empowerment skills through her activism, creating new leaders for the future.', 'Gbowee had worked in multiple healing spaces, for example, the Trauma Healing Office, where she traveled around Liberia to different communities, trying to educate people on how to deal with their traumas.', 'She felt as if this is her calling from God.', 'Because of the severity of the war and her trying to provide for her family, keeping a strong faith is used to help provide comfort through her work, especially since her target is towards weakened women and young boys who have been a part of the destructive process against their wills.', 'Through her activism work in her communities in Liberia, it is fueled by her experiences at home.', 'She is not able to mother her children the way she wanted, and to her, apart from her children, not losing faith is most important for her.', 'People whom she had helped in both Liberia and Ghana referred to her as being “Big Mama” or “Mother of Peace.”Religion and spirituality for Gbowee are considered essential in the peace coalition and the healing of everyone and everywhere.', ""She believes that to overcome injustices that take over people's livelihood and the way they live their day to day lives, it calls for true believers."", 'Being a religious person in these settings, for Gbowee, revenge is not the way to go.', 'She recounts reading the bible and searching for different accounts that encourage peace and not an “eye for an eye.”', 'For Gbowee, religion and its relevance helps to teach compassion and practice forgiveness which had also contributed to the success of her activism work.', 'Working with angered people who had dealt with social and political trauma, forgiveness became a part of the healing process and education for her intended audiences.', 'To Gbowee, forgiveness does not have a specific religious practice attached to it, but multiple.', 'She mentions at a peace conference that, “In my life’s journey, it hasn’t been just Christians who have reached out to me.', 'It hasn’t been just Muslims.', 'It has been people of different faiths.”In', 'terms of her contributions to the conceptions of violence, Gbowee also used her faith to push emphasis on why non-violence approaches are important.', 'This is especially prominent in the Women’s movement and her involvement while working with the Women in Peace-building Network (WIPNET).', 'The way she used helped break apart the comfortability of violence amongst people who are vulnerable is by using vulnerable people.', 'She used women who are also strong in faith and who have struggles with close contact with acts of violence although all were in a larger sense.', 'Many of the women that were active with Gbowee, faced violence such as sexual, physical, emotional, mental, and physical forces.', 'Traditional religious songs and dances were used in the non-violent, healing, and peace.', 'These dances and songs are used as a form of storytelling.', 'Gbowee expresses devotion to her Christian faith.', 'She opened the acknowledgment section of her memoir with these words: ""All praise, glory and honor to God for His unfailing love and favor toward me."":\u200a245\u200a She told students attending an EMU chapel in 2009: I didn\'t get there by myself... or anything I did as an individual, but it was by the grace and mercy of God....', 'He has held my hands.', 'In the most difficult of times, he has been there.', 'They have this song, ""Order my steps in your ways, dear Lord,"" and every day as I wake up, that is my prayer, because there\'s no way that anyone can take this journey as a peace builder, as an agent of change in your community, without having a sense of faith....', 'As I continue this journey in this life, I remind myself: All that I am, all that I hope to be, is because of God.', 'Gbowee told the EMU students that she went from being an angry, broke, virtually homeless, 25-year-old mother of four children with no idea of what her future might be, to listening to the voice of God in 1997.', 'She said God spoke to her through a five-year-old boy, a son whom she had nicknamed Nuku.', 'Comments made by Nuku made her realize that she had succumbed to ""crippling hopelessness"", and that her low self-esteem and sense of helplessness were destroying her family, which was already under assault from Liberia\'s brutal warfare.', ""Gbowee said she began taking one tiny step at a time, asking for God's help with each step."", 'And that God sent her angels in the form of human beings who reached out a hand at just the moment when she was most desperate.', 'As suggested by the interfaith character of the Liberian women\'s movement, Gbowee noted that others may derive the same support from religious faiths different from hers: It could be Jesus, it could be Mohammed, it could be Buddha, but there is no way that you can effect change in people\'s lives if there is not someone that you can rely on as the ""divine intervenor"" or the ""divine one"" that you can call on every day....', 'God is faithful, whoever you know him to me....', 'Take a step of faith and God will see to the rest.', 'In an interview with Odyssey Networks, Gbowee said that God could also be referred to as a ""Higher Power.""', 'She stressed that with a Higher Power accompanying you, you can ""rise up and do something to change your situation.""', 'She advised: ""Don\'t wait for a Gandhi, don\'t wait for a King, don\'t wait for a Mandela.', 'You are your own Mandela, you are your own Gandhi, you are your own King.""', 'Documentary film Gbowee is the narrator and central character in the 2008 documentary film Pray the Devil Back to Hell, which consists of scores of film and audio clips from the war period.', 'It took Best Documentary Feature in the 2008 Tribeca Film Festival in New York.', 'It has been broadcast across the United States as part of the ""Women, War & Peace"" series, which aired over five successive Tuesdays in October and early November 2011 on public television stations.', 'Pray has been used as an advocacy tool in conflict and post-conflict zones, such as Bosnia, Afghanistan, Iraq, South Africa, Rwanda, Mexico, Kenya, Cambodia, Russia, Sudan, the Democratic Republic of the Congo, and the West Bank: ""The reaction was remarkably similar: no matter how different the country and the society, women recognized themselves and started talking about how they could unite to solve their own problems.""', ':\u200a214\u200aIn the documentary, Gbowee emerges as someone able to laugh and enjoy life, despite what she has lived through: ""Gbowee comes across as a sharply strategic, scrappy, political maestro interfaith mobilizer of merriment.', 'Not the balloons-confetti-cupcakes-clown-type fun, but rather solidarity-inspiring conviviality.', 'You see women dancing, singing, smiling, wearing beautiful, white-as-doves clothing, and you even see laughter during sit-ins and protests.""', ""Awards and recognitions Gbowee's exposure to the New York philanthropic social set, facilitated by Disney (who had become a close friend), opened the door for a series of awards."", ""The first, from the John F. Kennedy School of Government at Harvard, came in early 2006, and then they began to arrive in accelerated fashion: recognition by Women's eNews, the Gruber Prize for Women's Rights, the John F. Kennedy Profile in Courage Award, the Living Legends Award for Service to Humanity, and several more."", 'In July 2011, EMU announced that Gbowee had been named its ""Alumna of the Year"".', '(Gbowee\'s eldest son, Joshua ""Nuku"" Mensah, entered EMU as a freshman in 2010, overlapping by one year with Sam Gbaydee Doe\'s eldest daughter, Samfee Doe, then a senior.)', 'The crowning honor came in October 2011 when the Norwegian Nobel Committee made Gbowee one of three female recipients of the 2011 Nobel Peace Prize.', 'In 2022, Gbowee was a Bartels World Affairs Fellows at Cornell University, giving the annual Bartels World Affairs Lecture.', 'Awards 2019 – Golden Plate Award of the American Academy of Achievement presented by Awards Council member Peter Gabriel.', '2016 –', 'Community of Christ International Peace Award 2014 – Oxfam America', 'Right the Wrong Award 2013 – The New York Women\'s Foundation Century Award 2013 – Barnard College Medal of Distinction 2012 – Olympic flag bearer in the 2012 Summer Olympics opening ceremony 2012 - James Parks Morton Interfaith Award 2011 – Nobel Peace Prize laureate 2011 – University of Massachusetts Lowell Greeley Scholar for Peace Studies 2011 – Villanova Peace Award from Villanova University 2011 – Alumna of the Year, Eastern Mennonite University 2010 – Living Legends Award for Service to Humanity 2010 – John Jay Medal for Justice from the John Jay College of Criminal Justice 2010 – Joli Humanitarian Award from Riverdale Country School 2009 – Gruber Prize for Women\'s Rights 2009 – John F.

Ricky Megee,Australian writers,Writers,"Ricky Megee (born 1970/1971) is an Australian, most notable for having been stranded in the Outback and surviving for 71 days in 2006. Megee later gave contradictory statements as to how he came to be stranded crossing the Northern Territory and Western Australia. On one occasion he said that his car broke down, and on another that he had been carjacked by an armed gang. However, a doctor later confirmed that Megee's appearance was consistent with having lived in extreme conditions. Like most deserts, the Tanami can reach 40 °C (104 °F) during the day but still be very cold at night. Megee made his own primitive shelters and survived by drinking rainwater and eating small animals and available vegetation for nourishment. He was eventually discovered by a group of station hands near Katherine, Northern Territory, and taken to Darwin for medical assistance. Although some doubts were later raised as to the exact chain of events as Megee related them, the police did not find evidence that a criminal offence had occurred. Early life Ricky Megee was born in 1970 or 1971 in Gippsland, Victoria; he later described his childhood as a happy one, until the family moved to Melbourne, where his father later killed himself. Megee worked at a variety of jobs. He was, variously, a carpet salesman, prawn fisherman, nightclub doorman, and an electrician. He eventually became a bailiff. Eventually, he went to jail after being involved in a fight in Perth, as well as for drug offences. In 2006 he was 35 years old and living in Queensland. Journey to Port Hedland and attack In January 2006 Megee had been offered work in a government department in Port Hedland, Western Australia. He accepted the job, and set off on the long drive, which he had made multiple times before. Driving a 2001 Mitsubishi Challenger he took the Buntine Highway, which for much of his journey was a desert track across the outback of the Northern Territory.The events leading to Megee being stranded are somewhat confused, and indeed, Megee's version of how events unfolded changed significantly over time. He first told his rescuers that his car had broken down, but then, The Washington Post reported, he claimed ""that he had been drugged by hitchhikers and left for dead"". Megee later elaborated on how this scenario unfolded, saying he had picked up a lone Aboriginal hitchhiker between the towns of Kalkaringi and Halls Creek. He believed that at some point the hitchhiker drugged Megee's drink. Megee said that although he normally always opened his own drinks from the car refrigerator, on this occasion he allowed his passenger to open one for him.Later, in his 2010 autobiography, Megee said that there had been three men sitting on the roadside, who had run out of petrol, and that he had offered to give one of them a lift to a petrol station. Megee also posited that he could have been stabbed with a drugged-syringe during a struggle. Either way, Megee later recalled feeling increasingly ""dazed and confused"", and then blacked out before he recovered consciousness hours later. He also said that his attackers did not leave him immediately: they over-powered and stunned him. He later awoke in their camp. They had a gun, wrote Megee, but never used it; they did bring him water. After an unknown period, the carjackers lifted camp and disappeared. Before they left, they stole his shoes, but left him with $12.30 which had been in his pocket.When he regained consciousness, he said, he was in a hole, covered in black plastic, which had had ""some rocks and dirt thrown on top"". Megee suggested that it was only the attempts by four dingoes to claw him that woke him up. Journey across the desert Megee walked for ten days through the northeastern fringe of the Tanami Desert. He often lost consciousness through heat exhaustion, as temperatures regularly went above 40 °C (104 °F). According to Mark Clifford, a local man who later witnessed Megee's arrival, although the temperatures were high, it was also the middle of the wet season during the time, which was in Megee's favour. When combined with the abundance of small wild animals and Megee's ""hardy constitution"", his chances of survival were, with hindsight, actually relatively good. However, it was never clearly established precisely how Megee became as lost as he did.Megee said that he survived by eating leeches, insects, snakes, ants and lizards, and edible plants. He drank water from ""various dams and waterholes"" and scavenged in the bush every evening, eating ""only one meal a day, just enough to stay alive"". When water was unavailable, he drank his urine after chilling it to suppress the flavour.Megee—""baked in the day and frozen at night""—created temporary shelters from the sun out of old branches, and eventually found a decrepit windmill. Megee said that he made ""a little humpy out of a feed trough that was at some cattle yards, obviously a mustering point, I thought to myself, so I've dragged it up on top of the dam, flipped it over and dug a hole and just lived in there for 10 weeks."" Megee became dangerously weak, to the extent that he was unable to travel as far on his daily foraging expeditions. At one point he suffered an abscess of the tooth that—weakened as he was—could have been fatal, and which he prised out of his mouth with his car keys. Rescue and recovery Megee was eventually discovered about 50 kilometres (31 mi) from Birrindudu Station, about 500 kilometres (310 mi) southwest of Katherine, Northern Territory. His rescuers were local station hands and their trainees, known as jackaroos. By now, Megee was starving, sunburnt, and suffering from malnutrition and exposure. Birrindudu Station manager, Mark Clifford, described Megee as ""just a walking skeleton"" when he was brought to the station, and said that the area he was found in was one of the ""most isolated places in Australia"".On 5 April 2006 Megee was flown to the Royal Darwin Hospital, where medical staff described him as ""emaciated, but...well hydrated"". While in Darwin Hospital, Megee was interviewed by Northern Territory police, although they dismissed suggestions that there was any question of criminal activity on Megee's part. Indeed, they said they were unable to find any evidence of criminality at all, or even Megee's stolen car. Megee discharged himself from hospital after six days. Aftermath Megee's Challenger was never recovered, and Megee himself lost 60 kilograms (130 lb), or over half his original bodyweight, which was over 100 kilograms (220 lb).The Sydney Morning Herald subsequently suggested that there were ""some doubts"" over elements of Megee's account, and reported that Megee was attempting to sell his story to ""a commercial television station"". It was also reported that the police, too, initially ""had doubts about the story because of Megee's previous minor drug convictions"". Megee refuted allegations that his account was in any way misleading and even offered to appear live on television and eat frogs to prove he was telling the truth. ABC Radio reported that Megee had told his story to them for free—although only after trying, unsuccessfully, to persuade the station to match a A$15,000 offer he said he had received from elsewhere. The doctor who treated Megee in Darwin commented that it was ""very difficult to either deny or validate"" his story, as he had responded so well to the treatment provided by dieticians, nutritionists and physicians.Bush Tucker Man Les Hiddins—considered an expert on outback survival—acknowledged that Megee's survival was not as surprising as might have been thought. It was possible, he said, to survive in the bush for up to three years, and that ""there are some areas where it's difficult to survive, and others where you can"". For example, the area where Megee was, Hiddins described as ""dry country which is, you know, that's pretty severe country in there"". Other survival experts credit Megee's survival on his ""instinctively solving the basic requirements of water, food and shelter—and adopting a survival mindset that pulled him through"".Megee subsequently wrote a book on his experience and emigrated to Dubai to work in construction.

Constantine Levidis,Greek writers,Writers,"Constantine N. Levidis (Greek: Κωνσταντίνος Λεβίδης; 1790, Constantinople – October 4, 1868, Athens) was a Greek scholar, writer, editor, considered as 'the father of Greek journalism'. Noted for his attempt to turn the Kingdom of Greece into a constitutional monarchy. Early life Levidis was born in Tatavla, Constantinople to the Levidis family, a noble Greek family of Byzantine origins. His father was Nikolaos A. Levidis, a man of letters, editor of many books and a prominent figure among the Greeks influenced by the Age of Enlightenment. His mother was also a woman of letters, highly educated and talented in music and languages. Levidis studied greatly throughout his youth. A polyglot, he spoke Albanian, Ancient Greek, English, French, German, Italian, Latin and Turkish with graceful fluency. He was passionate about history, literature and political sciences and graduated the University of Vienna before 1821, along with classmate Dimitri Kalergis. (Kalergis was later to become the prime mover in the Greek coup d'état of 1843, an insurrection which forced Otto of Greece to grant a proper constitution. Resulting in the Greek Constitution of 1844). It was also in Vienna were Levidis was initiated by Atanas Bogoridi in Filiki Eteria, the revolutionary organisation. When the Greek War of Independence broke out, Constantine along with his brother Alexander traveled to the Danubian Principalities in order to volunteer to the Sacred Band, the revolutionary Greek battalion in Wallachia. He fought under Prince Alexander Ypsilantis and took part in the Battle of Drăgăşani (June 19, 1821). Life in Greece After the formation of the First Hellenic Republic, Levidis became a public servant, appointed by governor Ioannis Kapodistrias to several important administrative committees and posts. In 1832, the Republic was succeeded by the Kingdom of Greece, with the underage Prince Otto of Bavaria as the first King of Greece. During his minority, Bavarian advisors were arrayed in a council of regency headed by Count Josef Ludwig von Armansperg. During the regency of the Bavarian council, Levidis was Councillor of the Finances. But soon found himself opposed and in 1836, after a severe clash with the regents he founded at an early period for the Greek press the historic newspaper Elpis or l'Esperance,(1836–1868) which he edited bilingually, first in Greek and German, later in Greek and French, with great ability till his death. The Nestor of the modern Greek Press, Levidis was a well-meaning patriot. By his talented and powerful writing in that journal, Levidis he mainly criticised to the outmost the Bavarian rule, first under the regency of Count Josef Ludwig von Armansperg and then under Otto himself. From the very first issue Levidis asked for the establishment of a proper constitution for the newly liberated Greek State. He distinguished himself by his violent attacks on the Bavarian-dominated regency but his fierce criticism and opposition nearly cost Levidis his life. In November 1837, only a year after the publication of the Elpis an attempt was made to assassinate Levidis. A Bavarian major named Feder, together with his company of ten more Bavarian army officers, attacked Levidis in the historic Athenian coffeehouse I Oraia Ellas were Levidis was a regular and he had been peacefully reading. Thanks to the intervention of the many civilians who rushed to defend him the Bavarians withdrew. Consequently, his press was confiscated the publication of the Elpis was forcefully interrupted. In 1843, Levidis actively participated and was one of the protagonists in the Greek coup d'état of 1843 over the adoption of a constitution, and in November he was first secretary and representative of Crete and of Messenia at the National Assembly of the same year. The Elpis resumed publication in 1844 right after the establishment of the constitution. In 1854, during the Crimean War the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland and the Second French Empire occupied Piraeus to prevent Greece declaring war on the Ottoman Empire. Greece was an ally of the Russian Empire and expected to join its side unless prevented. During the occupation, Elpis engaged in editorial attacks against the occupying Powers and were sympathetic to Russia. Because of his severe criticism, Levidis was briefly imprisoned by the French occupation forces. A proponent of the English Party, Levidis was a friend and political ally to Prince Alexander Mavrocordatos. His library was among the most treasured of his time and the salon at his large mansion in Patisia in Athens assembled and entertained many well-known politicians, army officers and aristocrats of the era. Literary activities A prolific author, Levidis published many books about the society, politics and history of his times. These works include an important study on King Otto, published in French, Quelques mots sur la Grece et l'ex Roi Othon: Adresses a l' opinion publique du monde civilise, Bruxelles 1863, another on the newly founded Greek state, Le Gouvernement et l'Administration en Grece depuis 1833 par un temoin oculaire Genes 1863 and a long historical and political treatise, La race hellenique et l' Occident.Η ελληνική φυλή και η Δύσις : Απάντησις εις την Συνταγματικήν, 1856. He coedited, with Alexander Rangabes, a French-Greek Lexicon in 1837, and also an Anglo-Greek dictionary. C.N Levidis also left behind a number of unpublished works of great importance. Among them, a History of the Filiki Eteria and a History of the Ottoman Empire. References ","[""Constantine N.

Mark Stevenson,British writers,Writers,"Mark Stevenson (born 1971) is a London-based British writer, businessman, public speaker and 'reluctant' futurologist, as well as a semi-professional musician and former comedian. Stevenson's first book, An Optimist's Tour of the Future, was released in the United Kingdom in January 2011 (February 2011 in the United States). His second, We Do Things Differently, followed on 5 January 2017. Education Stevenson graduated from the University of Salford in 1992 with a first-class honors degree in Information Technology. Early career Stevenson began his career working for Ovum, an information technology think tank. There, he co-authored reports on e-commerce and smart card technology and edited material related to CASE (computer-aided software engineering).After leaving Ovum, Stevenson worked as a freelancer, consulting primarily in the field of cryptography. Throughout this period, Stevenson was also a semi-professional musician. As a founding member of the band Clear, he co-wrote both music and lyrics, sang and played bass. The band's sole album, Coming Around, had the unique distinction of being funded by a company founded by the members but owned in part by the band's fans. The album, recorded in 2003, was produced by Andy Metcalfe at the studios of Glenn Tilbrook; it was mastered at Abbey Road. Comedy After leaving Clear, Stevenson took to comedy. His stand-up material was primarily focused on science. He has appeared at many comedy clubs, festivals and other venues. And although his current duties as businessman and author preclude a full-time career in comedy, he still occasionally makes appearances at clubs and on programs. He continues to write comedy. His farce, co-authored with Jack Milner, Octopus Soup! toured the UK in 2019. Writing In early 2011, Stevenson released a book entitled An Optimist's Tour of the Future (published by Profile Books in January 2011 in the UK and by Avery in February 2011 in the United States), which explores how invention and innovation can help overcome several of humanity's current problems. The book has since been translated into 12 languages.Notably, whilst writing An Optimist's Tour of the Future, Stevenson met the then President of the Maldives, Mohamed Nasheed and was present at the world's first underwater cabinet meeting. ""to draw attention to the climate change issue... he [Mohamed Nasheed] held an underwater cabinet meeting... I was there, I was lucky, I was one of four people that wasn't in the government or the support team that was in the water at this time, it was a very bizarre experience...""His second book, We Do Things Differently (also with Profile Books) is described as ""an enthralling picture of what can be done to address the world's most pressing dilemmas, a journey that offers a much needed dose of down-to-earth optimism. It is a window on (and a roadmap to) a different and better future"" Current Activities Following the success of his book, Stevenson is in high demand as a consultant and speaker on issues related to cultural change and technology trends - subjects he discusses on his podcast with comedian Jon Richardson and fellow futurist Ed Gillespie. He still maintains a musical persona as one half of progressive rock duo Quantum Pig. He fulfils a number of advisory roles notably to The UK Ministry of Defence (climate and national security), Medicines Sans Frontiers and Client Earth.

Aubrey Meyer,South African writers,Writers,"Aubrey Meyer (born 1947) is an author, violinist, composer and climate campaigner. A former member of the UK Green Party, he co-founded the Global Commons Institute in 1990. Life Aubrey Meyer was born in Yorkshire in 1947. He was raised in Cape Town, South Africa from 1952. In 1968 he gained a Bachelor of Music from the Music College, Cape Town University.He won Southern African Music Rights Organisation (SAMRO) scholarship for two years study abroad. From 1969 to 1971 he studied at the Royal College of Music in London. There he studied composition with Phillip Cannon and viola with the late Cecil Aronowitz. He won the International Music Company Prize and the Stanton Jeffries Music Prize. After the Royal College, he earned his living playing viola in orchestras: - principal viola in Scottish Theatre Ballet (1971), Ulster (1972), Gulbenkian Orchestra, CAPAB Orchestra and as a rank-and-file player in the Sadler's Wells Royal Ballet and finally in the London Philharmonic Orchestra.He has lived in London since 1980. During this period he continued composing. His one-act ballet 'Exequy' led to the award of a Master of Music degree in composition from the University of Cape Town. In 1980, Meyer returned to London, combining composition with playing and his ballet score Choros for the Sadlers Wells Royal Ballet for the ballet by David Bintley, won an Evening Standard Award (1984); reviews for Exequy & Choros.In 1988, while looking for a theme for a new composition, he heard about the environmentalist Chico Mendez who had been assassinated for his work in trying to prevent the destruction of the Brazilian rainforest, and he abandoned music for the UK Green Party of England and Wales. He co-founded the Global Commons Institute (GCI) in 1990 to start a programme to counter the threat of climate change based on the founding premise of 'Equity and Survival'.At the request of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) in 1992, Meyer conceived and presented his analysis of 'The Unequal Use of the Global Commons' to Working Group Three of the IPCC Second Assessment Report. This was dubbed 'Expansion and Divergence' and, led to an international rejection, at the UN climate negotiations in 1995, of the global cost benefit analysis of climate change by some economists from the US and UK. Contraction and Convergence This led to the development of GCI's framework of Contraction & Convergence (C&C). Introduced at the UNFCCC in 1996, C&C's approach to stabilizing greenhouse gases in the atmosphere at 'safe' level (by shrinking and sharing the limited and finite weight of such gases that future human activity can release into the atmosphere on an equal per capita basis) raises a key issue in the climate change debate.As a musician and string player, Meyer says the world must collaborate with musical discipline to avert runaway climate change: i.e. play C&C's 'carbon reduction score' in time, in tune and together.C&C was introduced to the UNFCCC at COP-2 Geneva:C&C became this iconic image in the months that followed.C&C was on the agenda at COP-3 Kyoto.C&C was on the agenda at COP-4 Buenos Aires when host Government published this in their conference newspaper.C&C was on the Agenda at COP-6 The Hague with Chairman Jan Pronk advocating it.C&C was on the agenda for COP-15 at Copenhagen, but was not agreed.C&C now considered by some as ""the most preferable equity framework"".C&C considered by others as ""the best possible solution to the twin problems of climate change and inequity"".Meyer has now enclosed C&C in the 'Carbon Budget Accounting Tool' (CBAT online) (CBAT notes) (CBAT appreciation) Comments by third parties ""Some proposals compensate the potential burden on developing nations with generous emissions allocation, whether as a simple strategy to obtain developing countries support for the regime or in a realisation of the global equity principle borrowed from social justice. A famous such proposal is 'Contraction and Convergence' developed by Aubrey Meyer."" Act Locally Trade Globally; Emissions Trading for Climate Policy Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development IEA ""I think Aubrey is a good gentleman. He has really been on this issue for years, for donkey’s years and he’s not giving up and he has the stamina. I think if we were all of us like Aubrey we would have achieved very high levels. Unfortunately not many of us have been that strong"". Joshua Wairoto, Deputy Director Kenya Met Office speaking at the UN Climate Negotiations in 2007.""I think that Aubrey Meyer has done an amazing job and has shown extraordinary persistence and ingenuity in working out a scheme of this kind and I very much admire him for it. Above all he has laid out a kind of intellectual and legal framework which is what we need if we are going to set global arrangements in place and these global arrangements should I believe be fully reflected in the Bill that is now before the UK Parliament to regulate climate change. This is not the time for half-measures or quarter measures or fiddling with the problem. It is important to lay out the principles and then see how they should best be interpreted to give effect to a common human problem"". Sir Crispin Tickell, former British Ambassador, Director of the Policy Foresight Programme James Martin 21st Century School Oxford University.""It seems to me that Contraction and Convergence is the basic principle that should guide climate policy, and that this policy is really unchallenged in principle by any of the climate models under discussion. Granted that it is good to have accurate models of how the world works, and to work out the numerical balances of C&C.

Herman Daly, Emeritus Professor, University of MarylandOn 4 February 2009, Lord Adair Turner (chair, UK Climate Change Committee) confirmed to the House of Commons Environmental Audit Committee that, ""it’s very difficult to imagine a long-term path for the world that is not somewhat related to a contract and converge type approach....we have made a very clear statement that we cannot imagine a global deal that is both do-able and fair, which doesn’t end up by mid century with roughly equal rights per capita to emit, and that is clearly said in the report"".On 24 June 2009, Rajendra Pachauri, (Chairman of the IPCC) said the following “ When one looks at the kinds of reductions that would be required globally, the only means for doing so is to ensure that there’s contraction and convergence, and I think there’s growing acceptance of this reality. I don’t see how else we might be able to fit within the overall budget for emissions for the world as a whole by 2050. We need to start putting this principle into practice as early as possible, so that by the time we reach 2050, we’re not caught by surprise, we’re well on a track for every country in the world that would get us there... On the matter of 'historic responsibility', there is no doubt that accelerating the rate of convergence relative to the rate of contraction is a way of answering that we really need to get agreement from Developed and Developing Countries to subscribe to this principle"".C&C is the most widely cited and arguably the most widely supported proposal for UNFCCC-compliance in play and many people believe C&C will yet prove to be the overarching principle that is adopted and that allows all nations to find common ground on how to achieve 'climate truth and reconciliation' and avert climate chaos.

Renos Apostolidis,Greek writers,Writers,"Renos Apostolidis (Greek: Ρένος Αποστολίδης; 2 March 1924 – 10 March 2004) was a Greek writer, philologist and literary critic. His father was Heracles N. Apostolidis, a notable journalist and director of the National Library between 1945 and 1959. His mother Elpiniki (née Zambeli) was a teacher. Early life Apostolidis was born in Athens in 1924. His father was Heracles N. Apostolidis, who was a journalist, chief editor in several newspaper agencies, head of Encyclopaedia of Pyrsos publishing, head of the National Library (1945–1959) and creator of the first Poetry and Short Stories Anthology. His mother, Elpiniki, was a teacher. After primary school, he attended Varvakeios High School (1935–1941), where on 28 October 1941 organized student abstention. Apostolidis participated in the banned, by Papandreou government, march on 3 December 1944 with EAM followers. From 1945, Apostolidis studied in the department of History and Archaeology of the University of Athens, but was forced to suspend his studies in order to pay his duties in the Greek Army during the Civil War, where he participated as Second lieutenant of the National Army. Living so close with destruction and death, Apostolidis stated that he swore to himself not to shoot a single bullet, but to record what he was going through for two and a half years in Grammos, Vitsi and during the cleansing operations of Roumeli and Peloponnese. As soon as he was released from his duties, he published Pyramid 67, a text about the Civil War. He was dismissed characterized as a second rank nationalist. In 1950 he completed his studies and had taught Ancient and Modern Greek, History and Latin in private high schools of Athens. He emerged as a writer in 1944, with the publishing of the essay ""Kairos tou einai"" in Grammata periodical. A year later, he issued his first essay collection Three stations of a march. He collaborated with several newspapers and periodicals of Athens as an editor of Eleutheria, Niki, Eikones, Gnoseis, Neoteron Lexicon Iliou, Aneksartitos Typos and other publications, as well as book critic in Grammata, Fititiki Foni, Deltion tou Vivliou, Kiklos, Kochlias, Nea Estia, Neoi Rithmoi, Nees Ikones, Ethnos, Ethnikos Kirikas, Epoptia and Nea Koinoniologia. Since 1951, he worked as chief editor and critic in the periodical Our Aeon, and in 1952, established with his father the periodical The New Greek. From the latter's pages he exercised intense criticism ""against the political and literary establishment"", and particularly against the ""Generation of the '30s"", accusing them of ""spiritual and ethical inadequacy"". For this posture of him, M. Karagatsis sued him and his father for reasons of copyright. In 1966 Apostolidis started publishing in serials in The New Greek fragments from the ""Diary"" of Ioannis Metaxas accompanied with his own sarcastic commentary. These publishes caused the reaction of the newly established organisation Party of 4 August, leader of which was Konstantinos Pleuris, who attacked Apostolidis from the organisation's newspaper and after Apostolidis's response Pleuris filed a lawsuit against him. The trial took place after the Coup of 21 April 1967, and the establishment of military dictatorship, and so the circulation of ""The New Greek"" stopped, which until then had published five articles related to the first two volumes of Metaxas's diary. In court, Apostolidis was sentenced, but in the Court of Appeal stated that it was not his intention to touch on the members of the Party of 4 August and the lawsuit was recalled. Politics From 1962 to 1964, Apostolidis served as a collaborator with the Directorate-General of the National Radio Foundation. In the parliamentary elections of 1963 he participated as a candidate under Spyridon Markezinis, while already since 1961 had written for the periodical of the youth of the Progressive party. In the municipal elections of 1964 descended as candidate for municipal consultant in Athens's municipality in the line up of Georgios Plytas. In 1964, Apostolidis was the head of an wrathful crowd of extreme Right-wings who entered the Parliament with the slogan Traitor Papandreou, Karamanlis, Papandreou Imposter. The crowd fought with parliament members of the center, an act for which Apostolidis was arrested and sentenced to two and a half years in prison, however, he served three months in total. Dictatorship During the dictatorship in Greece, in 1969, Colonel Georgios Papadopoulos imposed compulsory issue of the Short stories Anthology of Heracles N. Apostolidis in the Athenian Press, under condition of not being censored. Thus, in this way texts belonging to dissidents were published like those of the politically exiled Demetris Hantzis. However, the publication in two newspapers part of Renos Apostolidis's novel The A2, written in 1968 about the Greek Civil War, provoked the intervention of censorship and the suspension of the publishing after direct interference of Ioannes Ladas, the general secretary of the Ministry of Public Order and one of the orchestrators of the 1967 coup d'état. Later years After the end of the dictatorship, until 1979, Apostolidis continued writing critics in the periodical Tetramina and published several of his works. In his later years he published lectures and appeared on television for matters regarding the Greek language, education and literature. He was also honorary guest in presentations of his works. He was a supporter of the polytonic writing, the historical Greek orthography and the teaching of ancient Greek from prototypes in schools. Death Apostolidis died on 10 March 2004 after acute stroke. He received a non-religious burial, due to him being an agnostic and libertarian. Works Renos Apostolidis was a prolific writer. During his lifetime he published over 30 books. His first published work was Three Stations a Path (1945). Some of his most famous works are Wings of The Stork (1949), Poet Letters (1949), Pyramid 67 (1950), Modern Greek (1952), His Nipples and Manuscripts of Max Tod (1960), Criticism of War (1962), Corridors (1979), The Furies (1980) and Cats (1989), and Vortex (1993). One book, Centauri was published posthumously, in 2012.

Gerald Basil Edwards,Guernsey writers,Writers,"Gerald Basil Edwards (G. B. Edwards) (July 8, 1899 – December 29, 1976) was a British author. Biography Edwards was born in Vale, Guernsey, the son of Thomas Edwards, a quarry owner, by his wife Harriet (née Mauger). He served in the Royal Guernsey Light Infantry, then spent four years reading English at the University of Bristol (1919–1923), from which he apparently did not graduate; following this, he entered the literary world of London.Edwards is known for The Book of Ebenezer Le Page, which was published posthumously in 1981. Edwards had worked on his great novel for many years but only completed it towards the end of his life, presenting the typescript to his friend Edward Chaney in August 1974, rather in the manner that the fictional Ebenezer bequeaths his 'Book' to Neville Falla in the novel. The typescript was rejected by all the publishers it was shown to and only after Edwards' death was it taken up by Hamish Hamilton who arranged for John Fowles to write an introduction. It was widely and very favourably reviewed, among others by William Golding and Guy Davenport. Harold Bloom included it in his Western Canon. Penguin produced a paperback and it was published in America and in French translation. It has since been published in Italian by Elliot Edizioni. It is currently in print in Britain and America with New York Review of Books in their Classics series. In the late 1920s and '30s Edwards had been regarded as a writer and intellectual of great promise, one who might fill the shoes of D. H. Lawrence, whose biography Cape commissioned him to write. He occasionally contributed to Middleton Murry's Adelphi magazine but never completed his larger projects. Eventually his friends Murry, John Stewart Collis and Stephen Potter gave up their hopes in him. By 1933 he had abandoned his wife and children and he did not re-establish contact with his daughter until decades later. He became an itinerant teacher of drama and, latterly, a minor civil servant and something of a recluse. Towards the end of his life, he became a lodger in a house near Weymouth where he was 'discovered' by art student Edward Chaney. The latter encouraged him to complete his novel and eventually got it published. Edwards died in Weymouth, Dorset. In September 2008 Chaney and Jane Mosse unveiled Guernsey's first blue plaque on Edwards's father's house.A biography of G. B. Edwards by his friend Chaney was published in September 2015 by Blue Ormer Publishing. See also Ebenezer Le Page The Book of Ebenezer Le Page References Chaney, Edward, Genius Friend: G. B.

Eino Leino,Finnish writers,Writers,"Eino Leino (born Armas Einar Leopold Lönnbohm; 6 July 1878 – 10 January 1926) was a Finnish poet and journalist who is considered one of the pioneers of Finnish poetry and a national poet of Finland. His poems combine modern and Finnish folk elements. Much of his work is in the style of the Kalevala and folk songs in general. Nature, love, and despair are frequent themes in Leino's work. He is beloved and widely read in Finland today. Leino's birthday on 6 July was named Eino Leino Day (Eino Leinon päivä) as well as day of Finnish poetry and summer in 1992, and it is an established Finnish flag day. Early life Eino Leino was baptized as Armas Einar Leopold Lönnbohm in Paltamo as the seventh and youngest son in a family of ten children. Leino's family lived in the Hövelö house in Paltaniemi village. Leino's father had changed his name from Antti Mustonen to Anders Lönnbohm to improve his chances of marrying his future upper-class wife, Anna Emilia Kyrenius. Eino's older brother Kasimir Leino was an important cultural figure in Finland. He was a poet, critic, and theatre director. Eino and Kasimir Leino founded a literature journal together in 1898.Leino published his first poem at the age of 12 and a collection of poems, Maaliskuun lauluja, at 18.Leino's parents died while he was still in school. He started school in Kajaani and continued in Oulu and Hämeenlinna, where he boarded with relatives. After graduating from the Hämeenlinna secondary school, Leino started studying at the University of Helsinki. Writing career Early in his career Eino Leino was much loved and praised by the critics. He joined literary and newspaper circles and became a member of the Young Finnish circle. Among Leino's friends were the artist Pekka Halonen and Otto Manninen, who gained fame as a poet and translator.As early as November 1917, Eino Leino had annoyedly warned in the Sunnuntai magazine that the country was ""on the brink of civil war,"" and fiercely criticized the Socialists as they set out to ""pursue their cause with civil blood and the stings of a foreign conqueror"" (No. 40-41 / 1917). The political situation, which escalated into the Finnish Civil War, was a bitter experience for Leino, who had always written for tolerance and also appreciated the labor movement from which he had good friends. Leino experienced the events of the spring of 1918 in the Red-conquered Helsinki, and he described his experiences in the report novel The Conquest of Helsinki (1918). He greeted the German Baltic Sea Division, which had invaded southern Finland and conquered Helsinki, as a liberator. But on the other hand, Leino later drove a general amnesty for Red Side line men and women in prisons and demanded the abolition of the death penalty. In April 1918, Leino's six-part series of articles called ""For the Finnish Workers"" was published in the Social Democratic magazine Työn valta (""Power of Labor""), in which he, as an impartial writer belonging to the ""civilized poverty"", strongly appealed for peace and mutual understanding. “Social democracy would no longer have a future in Finland unless it was able to internalize the ""eternal ideals"" of legitimacy, democracy and civil liberty,” he wrote.After the Finnish Civil War, Leino's idealistic faith for national unity collapsed, and his influence as a journalist and polemicist weakened. He was granted a State writer's pension in 1918 at the age of forty. Although publishing prolifically, he had financial problems and his health deteriorated. ""Life is always a struggle with eternal forces,"" Leino said in a letter in 1925 to his friend Bertel Gripenberg. Leino published over 70 books of poems and stories. The most famous of these are the two poem collections Helkavirsiä (1903 and 1916), in which he extensively uses Finnish mythology and folklore. In addition to writing poetry, Eino Leino wrote in newspapers about theatre and culture in general, and translated works of important writers such as Runeberg and Goethe. He was the first person in Finland to translate Dante's Divine Comedy into Finnish.In the summer of 1921, Leino traveled to Estonia for a written tour organized by the Finnish-Estonian friends Aino and Gustav Suits. With his poetry evenings, presentations and celebrations in Tartu and Tallinn, the trip became a success, and Eino Leino was received everywhere as a significant poet. After his trip to Estonia, he signed his third marriage to bank clerk Hanna Laitinen. The desperate attempt to gain support and security ended almost immediately in the separation of the spouses. In 1921, Leino applied for exemption from Finnish citizenship. He wrote letters to President K. J. Ståhlberg and Estonian Head of State Konstantin Päts asking to become an Estonian citizen. Leino was tired of the lack of scholarships and the criticism he received.Leino was married three times and had one daughter, Helka. He died in 1926 at the age of 47 and later he was buried at the Hietaniemi Cemetery in Helsinki. Already at that time as a famous man, he was buried at the expense of the state, and the funeral was attended by President L. K. Relander and other statesmen of the country.The most detailed biography of Leino was written in 1930s by his lover and colleague L. Onerva. In the dramatic story Onerva is also writing about her own life.There is no absolute certainty about the cause of Eino Leino's death. In the work of the writer Hannu Mäkelä, Mestari, the cause of Leino's death is described as advanced spinal cord disease and calcification of blood vessels, which is why blood had leaked into the brain. It is said that it had previously confused Leino's abdominal functions. According to Mäkelä, the cause of death was determined by both Dr. Wasastjerna and Dr. Lindén. On the other hand, the cause of Leino's death has also been suggested to be syphilis by Leino's personal doctor Väinö Lindén on the basis of L. Onerva's biographical margin. Literary style and importance Leino is held to be the first and most important shaper of national romanticism in Finnish literature. Actually, Leino coined the term national neoromantism by himself to characterize the works by talents of young Finland such as composer Jean Sibelius, painter Akseli Gallen-Kallela and architect Eliel Saarinen.Leino's style developed during his 35 year career. In his early works, including his most famous collection Helkavirsiä (1903) influence of the national epic Kalevala is visible. In the middle of his career Leino translated classics of world literature to Finnish. At the same time he wrote his own works in several genres: poetry, plays, essays, reviews and other pieces of journalism.

Takashi Araya,Japanese writers,Writers,"Takashi Araya (荒谷 卓, Romanization: Araya Takashi, 1 January 1959 (Shōwa 34) - ) is a Japanese martial artist and author, who is the director at Shiseikan, Meiji Shrine. He was a Japan Ground Self-Defense Force colonel and has organized the Special Forces Group (特殊作戦群, Tokushusakusengun) as the first leader. Biography Takashi Araya attended Ōdate Homei High School in Akita Prefecture and graduated from Tokyo University of Science. The Araya family served the Northern Fujiwara noble family through a gold mining business. When he was a student at the Tokyo University of Science, he majored in remote sensing of artificial satellites. While attending the University of Science, he practiced karate mainly at the Kyokushin Nagareyama Dojo, and also practiced at the Meiji Jingu Martial Arts Dojo, Meiji Shrine. In the summer of the 4th year of Science University, his teacher advised him to join the Japan Self-Defense Forces and said, ""You look like a soldier. Join the Self-Defense Forces."" After graduating, he joined the Ground Self-Defense Force as an executive candidate.After graduating from the executive candidate school, he worked as a unit in the regular department and qualified for airborne descent, executive ranger, and executive in information. He worked in the 19th Ordinary Regiment of the Western Army as a beginner executive. After becoming an intermediate executive, he worked at the Ground Self-Defense Force Research School (currently the JGSDF Military Intelligence School), where he studied Information Gathering Satellites. Thereafter, he entered the JGSDF Staff College, Command and General Staff Course (CGS). After graduating from the same school, he worked as a company commander of the 1st Airborne Brigade and the JGSDF 39th Infantry Regiment. In 1995, Araya studied abroad at the German military school Bundeswehr Command and Staff College. The following year, he returned to Japan in 1996 and worked for the Ground Staff Office Defense Department. In the Ground Staff Office, he worked in the Research Team, Defense Team, Operations Team, and also in the Strategic Laboratory, Defense Policy Division, Defense Bureau, and the Defense Agency. During this time, he was involved in reviewing defense strategies, formulating medium- to long-term defense capability development plans, defense legislation such as the Terrorism Special Measures Law, and North Korea issues. In addition, at the Ground Staff Office, where the special forces creation design was underway, he struggled to prepare for the establishment of the special forces,. He gained the personal reputation as ""the expert of special operations of the Ground Self-Defense Force"".In 2002, in order to establish the first special forces of the Japan Ground Self-Defense Force, he studied abroad for one year in the United States Army Special Forces (Green Beret) and received education on special missions. After returning to Japan, Araya became the commander of the Special Operations Group formation preparation team, and prepared the special forces training curriculum. Simultaneously, he secured personnel from among the JSDF who volunteered all across the country. When selecting personnel, they set strict selection criteria similar to those of the British and American Special Forces and conducted a selection test. However, there were some divisions that did not pass. The division commander protested and they directly faced this problem. In 2004, a special operations group was established and Araya became the first group leader. Araya led the special operations group for three years under the guidance policy of ""special operations group warrior Bushido"". During his tenure, he continued his service at Yasukuni Shrine, which he had occasionally performed since he was a beginner executive. In various missions, there were often disagreements with the Ground Staff on the development and command relations of the special operations group, but there was no compromise on the strength of the unit. Shigeru Ishiba, then Director general of the Defense Agency, favorably evaluated Araya's work as the first group leader in his book ""National Defense.""In 2007 (Heisei 19), he retired from the Special Operations Group. Afterward, he worked as the Chief Research and Development Officer of the GRD (JGSDF Ground Research and Development Command). Director of 3rd Laboratory, 2nd Research Division, General Research Department, etc. In August 2008 he retired with the rank, 1st Class Rikusa (Colonel). After retiring, he became the director of the Meiji Jingu Shiseikan in October 2009, and worked to enhance the youth nature school and martial arts courses to learn Japanese spiritual culture. He also focused on holding martial arts courses outside Japan, and helped establish the European-based International Shiseikan Martial Arts Association, the Russian Shiseikan Martial Arts Club, and the Moscow State University Martial Arts Club. He resigned in October 2018. In November 2018, the ""International Symbiotic Creation Association, Kumano Asuka Musubi No Sato"" was established in Asuka-cho, Kumano city, Mie Prefecture, and started activities in the UNESCO Sacred Sites and Pilgrimage Routes in the Kii Mountain Range. The activities are aimed at creating a better world by reawaking the resilience and power of the human psyche, through self-sustaining daily activities and experiences with friends. A goal is to forge a better future for people globally based on the greatness of nature and Japanese traditional culture. According to Araya, global capitalism will collapse and approach a period of total human transformation, and how to build the world beyond this period is an urgent issue for humankind. In order for humankind to maintain its history for as long as possible, it is necessary to abandon the principle of competition and base it on the order of harmony and symbiosis, and natural beliefs such as animism are clues. It is natural that different cultures and traditional customs are formed according to the different natural environment in each region of the world. Instead of forcibly unifying them with one idea or order, each cultural custom is mutually shared. He argues that a world that respects and acknowledges should be the world order of post-global capitalism. As a concrete activity for that purpose, in order to form regional cultural communities around the world that eliminate the influence of money as much as possible and to build a network that connects with each other, the ""International Symbiotic Creation Association"" was established with the base in Kumano. The reason for being based in Kumano is that the Nankii Peninsula is the oldest area of natural beliefs in Japan. Controversy Araya is accused of being a COVID-19 denier, accusing mass media of hyping concerns about the pandemic and the deep state.

Information Gathering Satellites.', 'Thereafter, he entered the JGSDF Staff College, Command and General Staff Course (CGS).', 'After graduating from the same school, he worked as a company commander of the 1st Airborne Brigade and the JGSDF 39th Infantry Regiment.', 'In 1995, Araya studied abroad at the German military school Bundeswehr Command and Staff College.', 'The following year, he returned to Japan in 1996 and worked for the Ground Staff Office Defense Department.', 'In the Ground Staff Office, he worked in the Research Team, Defense Team, Operations Team, and also in the Strategic Laboratory, Defense Policy Division, Defense Bureau, and the Defense Agency.', 'During this time, he was involved in reviewing defense strategies, formulating medium- to long-term defense capability development plans, defense legislation such as the Terrorism Special Measures Law, and North Korea issues.', 'In addition, at the Ground Staff Office, where the special forces creation design was underway, he struggled to prepare for the establishment of the special forces,.', 'He gained the personal reputation as ""the expert of special operations of the Ground Self-Defense Force"".', 'In 2002, in order to establish the first special forces of the Japan Ground Self-Defense Force, he studied abroad for one year in the United States Army Special Forces (Green Beret) and received education on special missions.', 'After returning to Japan, Araya became the commander of the Special Operations Group formation preparation team, and prepared the special forces training curriculum.', 'Simultaneously, he secured personnel from among the JSDF who volunteered all across the country.', 'When selecting personnel, they set strict selection criteria similar to those of the

operations group warrior Bushido"".', 'During his tenure, he continued his service at Yasukuni Shrine, which he had occasionally performed since he was a beginner executive.', 'In various missions, there were often disagreements with the Ground Staff on the development and command relations of the special operations group, but there was no compromise on the strength of the unit.', 'Shigeru

daily activities and experiences with friends.', 'A goal is to forge a better future for people globally based on the greatness of nature and Japanese traditional culture.', 'According to Araya, global capitalism will collapse and approach a period of total human transformation, and how to build the world beyond this period is an urgent issue for humankind.', 'In order for humankind to maintain its history for as long as possible, it is necessary to abandon the principle of competition and base it on the order of harmony and symbiosis, and natural beliefs such as animism are clues.', 'It is natural that different cultures and traditional customs are formed according to the different natural environment in each region of the world.', 'Instead of forcibly unifying them with one idea or order, each cultural custom is mutually shared.', 'He argues that a world that respects and acknowledges should be the world order of post-global capitalism.', 'As a concrete activity for that purpose, in order to form regional cultural communities around the world that eliminate the influence of money as much as possible and to build a network that connects with each other, the ""International Symbiotic Creation Association"" was established with the base in Kumano.', 'The reason for being based in Kumano is that the Nankii Peninsula is the oldest area of natural beliefs in Japan.', 'Controversy Araya is accused of being a COVID-19 denier, accusing mass media of hyping concerns about the pandemic and the deep state.', ""He's also accused of right-wing views of wanting to

Guy de Pourtalès,Swiss writers,Writers,"Guy de Pourtalès (4 August 1881 Berlin – 12 June 1941 Lausanne) was a Swiss author. Early life and education He was the son of Herman Alexander de Pourtalès (1847–1904) and his first wife, Marguerite ""Daisy"" Marcet (1857–1888). Guy was born in Berlin, where his father at that time was an officer in the service of the Prussian king Wilhelm I. When he was six years old, the family returned to Switzerland, where they lived first at Malagny near Versoix in the Canton of Geneva and then, after his father's second marriage (with Hélène Barbey) in 1891, at Mies in the Canton de Vaud. Guy de Pourtalès went to schools in Geneva and in Vevey and then to the gymnasium in Neuchâtel. After his matura in 1899, he studied in Germany. In Karlsruhe, he began to study Chemistry, which he abandoned soon in favor of musical studies, which he continued from 1902 to 1905 at the University of Bonn. In 1905, he moved to Paris, where he studied literature at the Sorbonne. Career as a writer Guy de Pourtalès published his first novel in Paris in 1910. One year later, he married Hélène Marcuard, with whom he had three children, and in 1912, his French nationality was restored upon his demand, since his family were Huguenots who had fled from France to Neuchâtel after the Edict of Fontainebleau revoking the Edict of Nantes. Just before World War I, his second novel appeared.In 1914, he was drafted into service in the French army as a translator for the British troops in Flanders. At Ypres, he was gassed in 1915 and evacuated to Paris where he slowly recovered. He co-founded the Société littéraire de France, where he also published in 1917 his Deux contes de fées pour les grandes personnes (""Two fairy tales for grown-ups""). At the end of the war, he again served as a translator, this time for the American troops. After he was diagnosed with pulmonary tuberculosis in 1919, he rented the castle of Etoy in the Canton of Vaud in Switzerland in 1921 and henceforth would spend several months a year there. A large part of his literary work was written in Etoy.From the 1920s on, Pourtalès published a series of romantic biographies of musicians and also wrote essays, critiques, and journalistic pieces for a variety of French magazines, amongst them the Nouvelle Revue Française. He also began to translate the works of Shakespeare in French, which raised the interest of Jacques Copeau. Pourtalès's translation of Measure for Measure was performed by the company of Georges Pitoëff in 1920 in Geneva and in Lausanne (with music by Arthur Honegger), and his translation of The Tempest was played by the company of Firmin Gémier in 1929 in Monte Carlo and at the Odéon theater in Paris.In 1937, he published La Pêche miraculeuse, the novel for which he is best known today and which won him the Grand Prix du roman de l'Académie française.Pourtalès's health had been slowly deteriorating, and when World War II broke out, he was severely ill and wouldn't leave Etoy anymore. His son Raymond (1914–1940), who served in the French army, fell in combat on 28 May 1940.

George Fletcher Moore,Irish writers,Writers,"George Fletcher Moore (10 December 1798 – 30 December 1886) was a prominent early settler in colonial Western Australia, and ""one [of] the key figures in early Western Australia's ruling elite"" (Cameron, 2000). He conducted a number of exploring expeditions; was responsible for one of the earliest published records of the language of the Australian Aborigines of the Perth area; and was the author of Diary of Ten Years Eventful Life of an Early Settler in Western Australia. Early life Moore was born on 17 December 1798 at Bond's Glen, Donemana, County Tyrone, Ireland. He was educated at Foyle College in Derry, and at Trinity College in Dublin. He graduated in law in 1820, and spent the next six years at the Irish Bar, but seeing little prospect of advancement he decided to pursue a judicial career in the colonies. Moore enquired at the Colonial Office after an official posting to the recently established Swan River Colony in Western Australia, but was told that such appointments were the responsibility of the Governor of Western Australia, Sir James Stirling, and could not be guaranteed by the Colonial Office. However, the Colonial Office promised him a letter of introduction should he choose to emigrate. In Australia Moore sailed from Dublin bound for Western Australia on board Cleopatra, arriving at the Swan River Colony on 30 October 1830. He then learned that William Mackie had been appointed Chairman of the Courts of Petty and Quarter Sessions in the previous December, effectively eliminating any chances of an official judicial appointment for Moore. He therefore turned his attention to the problems of obtaining his land grant and establishing a farm. By the end of November, Moore had claimed a large area of land in the Avon Valley, which he had not yet seen but had been highly recommended by Robert Dale, who had explored the area in July. Moore also obtained half of William Lamb's grant in Upper Swan by agreeing to undertake the improvements necessary to secure the entire title. In September 1831, Robert Dale led a large party in cutting a road from Guildford to the Avon Valley. Eager to see his grant for the first time, Moore joined the party. On arriving at the intended site for the town of York, Moore and Dale explored much of the Avon River, correctly guessing that the Avon and the Swan were in fact the same river. The information Moore gathered on this expedition guided him in relocating his inland grant to an area with vastly better pasture land. In February 1832, Moore finally obtained the judicial appointment he had hoped for, being appointed a Commissioner of the Civil Court. With good land and a regular salary, Moore rapidly consolidated his position as a leading farmer. By 1833 he had one of the largest flocks of sheep in the colony. Moore was unusual amongst his contemporaries in that he developed friendly, lasting relationships with the Indigenous Australians of the area. As he learned more of their culture, his interest deepened, and he began to take a scholarly interest in their language and customs. In the middle of 1833, Moore published in the Perth Gazette the first account of the customs of the Aborigines of the area. He advocated compensating the natives for the loss of their land, and also promoted the idea of Christianising them. For a while he funded Robert Lyon in his attempt to learn their language, then set out to learn it himself. Between 1834 and 1836, Moore went exploring a number of times. In January 1834, he explored up the Swan River, finally confirming the belief that the Swan and Avon were the same river. In April 1835, he discovered extended pastoral land near the Garban River, which was subsequently renamed the Moore River. In March 1836, he explored the land between the Moore River and the northern end of the Avon River. In October 1836, he joined a party under John Septimus Roe, which explored inland in the hopes of finding an inland sea, finding instead extremely arid land. In 1834, A collection of Moore's letters to family in England were published under the title Extracts from the Letters and Journals of George Fletcher Moore Esq., Now Filling a Judicial Office at the Swan River Settlement. The publication was at the request of Moore's father Joseph Moore, and George Fletcher Moore may have been unaware of the publication for some time afterwards. In July of the same year, Moore's judicial position was handed over to Mackie, and Moore was instead appointed Advocate-General. Moore was initially very upset about his re-appointment, because of the loss of social status in changing from a judge to a lawyer. His new position, however, accorded him a seat on the colony's Legislative Council, and was therefore a position of great influence. Moore took a dislike to many of Governor Stirling's policies, and opposed him on a number of measures. In particular, from March 1835 he continually opposed Stirling's proposal to raise a troops of mounted police to protect against attack by natives. Early in 1839, John Hutt took office as governor. He shared Moore's interest in the language of the Aborigines, and shortly after his arrival the two of them commenced a project to produce a dictionary of the Aboriginal language. By August 1840 the dictionary was largely complete. Moore took extended leave in March 1841, returning to London for two years. In 1842, Moore's dictionary was published under the title A Descriptive Vocabulary of the Language in Common Use Amongst the Aborigines of Western Australia. Moore returned to Western Australia in 1843, when the Swan River Colony was in a severe recession. Over the next few years, he vigorously opposed a number of proposed measures intended to soften the effects of the recession on leading land holders. Moore claimed that most of the large land holders that were facing economic ruin had been brought to that position through mismanagement. His hard line made many influential enemies, and his popularity plummeted. His views began to attract ridicule both in the Legislative Council and in the press, but he remained influential as he had the confidence of successive governors John Hutt and Andrew Clarke. On 29 October 1846, Moore married Fanny, stepdaughter of Governor Clarke. In the final months of 1846, both the Governor and Colonial Secretary Peter Broun were seriously ill. As son-in-law of the Governor, Moore was one of a few persons allowed access to the Governor by his doctors. Because of this substantial advantage, Moore was appointed acting colonial secretary in November 1846. Broun died that same month, and Clarke died in February 1847, but Moore continued acting in the position until the arrival of the new colonial secretary, Richard Madden, in March 1848. Under the acting governorship of Frederick Irwin, Moore's popularity waned further. The government of Irwin and Moore was extremely unpopular; Battye (1924) writes ""every administrative act was viewed with suspicion. ... Long years of depression and struggle had made the colonists pessimistic, and ... they threw the blame on the Government of the day."" The eventual appointments of Madden and the new governor, Charles Fitzgerald, left Moore with almost no influence in the new government. Later life and death Early in 1852, Moore took leave and returned to Ireland. His claimed reason for taking leave was to visit his sick father, but Cameron (2000) states that his chief reason was concern for the mental health of his wife. Her condition deteriorated in Ireland, and she refused to return to Western Australia. Moore was forced to resign his seat; his request for a pension was denied. Fanny Moore died in 1863, but Moore still did not return to Western Australia. In about 1878, the editor of The West Australian, Sir Thomas Cockburn Campbell, sought and was granted permission to serialise Moore's letters. The letters appeared in the West Australian in 1881 and 1882. On seeing them in print, Moore decided to republish them in book form. They were published in 1884 as Diary of Ten Years Eventful Life of an Early Settler in Western Australia. Moore died in his London apartment on 30 December 1886. Stannage (1978) writes that he died ""apparently friendless"", and Cameron (2000) adds ""it was a sad end to a worthwhile colonial career."" References Battye, James Sykes (1924).

new government.', 'Later life and death Early in 1852, Moore took leave and returned to Ireland.', 'His claimed reason for taking leave was to visit his sick father, but Cameron (2000) states that his

request for a pension was denied.', 'Fanny Moore died in 1863, but Moore still did not return to Western Australia.', ""In about 1878, the editor of The West Australian, Sir Thomas Cockburn Campbell,

Gregory Erdstein,Australian writers,Writers,"Gregory Erdstein is an Australian film director and writer, best known for the indie comedy That's Not Me. Career Erdstein is a graduate of the Victorian College of the Arts, School of Film & TV, Melbourne, Australia. Erdstein has collaborated with his wife, actress/writer Alice Foulcher, on several films including the controversial short film Picking up at Auschwitz, the Tropfest finalist short A Bit Rich and Paris Syndrome. They spent most of 2014 as artists in residence at the Cité internationale des arts in Paris, France, where they made Paris Syndrome, and co-wrote the screenplay for their first feature film, That's Not Me.In 2014 also co-wrote and co-directed the short film Two Devils, with Van Diemen's Land director Jonathan auf der Heide. It premiered at the 2014 Melbourne International Film Festival.In 2015 Erdstein commenced production on his debut feature, That's Not Me, which filmed in Melbourne, Australia and Los Angeles, USA. The film will had its World Premiere in February 2017 at the Santa Barbara International Film Festival, and Australian Premiere in June 2017 at the Sydney Film Festival - where it came Fourth at the Foxtel Movies Audience Awards. That's Not Me has been met with overwhelmingly positive reviews and a Rotten Tomatoes approval rating of 87%. The Guardian ranked it #5 of the Top 10 Australian Films of 2017, with critic Luke Buckmaster giving it a 4 star review. Andy Howell of Ain't It Cool praised Foulcher's lead performance, writing: ""[Alice Foulcher] shoulders all the drama and gives one of the best twin performances I’ve ever seen... Having nuanced drama embedded in a comedy is a tightrope walk, but she’s got the skills to land it."" The film was also flagged by the Santa Barbara Independent as a Must-See movie of the Santa Barbara International Film Festival, and sold out a number of sessions at the festival. Junkee Media called the film ""An emotionally resonant and comedic quarter life crisis… It’s a simple set-up delivered endlessly in comedy, but managed so well in That's Not Me that you remember how rare it is that balance is achieved in Australian films."" The Sydney Arts Guide praised the film and performances, writing: ""There’s not a dud note in That's Not Me thanks to a solid foundation in a script by Alice Foulcher and Gregory Erdstein, and anchored by a winning lead performance by Foulcher and helmed with an assured hand by Erdstein. The support casting is impeccable…Isabel Lucas is ferociously good"". Jake Watt of Switch called the film ""a marvel of indie ingenuity, with dollops of charm and confident direction."" Karl Quinn writing for The Age said the film is ""bursting with comedy, humanity and interesting ideas"", the Huffington Post called it ""a stunning exploration of identity, the industry and the thirst for fame…the perfect blend of comedy and tragedy"", whilst Concrete Playground praised it as ""earnest, astute, insightful and thoroughly amusing. This is a movie that is both universal and unmistakably Australian – and that’s just one of many delicate balancing acts that That’s Not Me achieves"".

William Henry Pyne,English writers,Writers,"William Henry Pyne (1769 in London – 29 May 1843 in London) was an English writer, illustrator and painter, who also wrote under the name of Ephraim Hardcastle. He trained at the drawing academy of Henry Pars in London. He first exhibited at the Royal Academy in 1790. He specialized in picturesque settings including groups of people rendered in pen, ink and watercolour. Pyne was one of the founders of the Royal Watercolour Society in 1804. Works Pyne's book The Costume of Great Britain, including 60 paintings of professional and working-class men and women and scenes from everyday life (published by William Miller in 1805), attracted the attention of the publisher Rudolph Ackermann, and Pyne was to engrave and write for many of his projects, including writing the text for the first two volumes of the very successful illustration-centred The Microcosm of London. He was his own publisher for The History of the Royal Residences (1816–1819), a large illustrated book with 100 engravings of the exteriors and interior decorations and furnishings of Windsor Castle, St. James's Palace, Carlton House, Kensington Palace and Hampton Court Palace. It caused financial difficulties for him – he was imprisoned for debt more than once, and died a poor man in 1843.As Ephraim Hardcastle, he wrote gossipy columns on art for the Literary Gazette, which in 1824 were collected in 2 volumes as Wine and Walnuts, or After-dinner Chit-chat. He wrote for other journals, and in 1825 published a novel The Twenty-ninth of May, or Rare Doings at the Restoration.Pyne's watercolours are in major museum collections, such as the Royal Collection and the British Museum. His son, George Pyne (1800–01 - 1884), was also a painter in watercolour, writer on drawing and perspective. Gallery References Further reading Ford, John, ""Pyne, William Henry."" Grove Art Online.

José María Salaverría,Spanish writers,Writers,"José María Salaverría e Ipenza (1873–1940) was a Spanish journalist and writer. Biography Born on Vinaròs (province of Castellón) on 28 May 1873, he moved early in his life with his family to San Sebastián.In his capacity as a journalist he wrote in several newspapers such as ABC (1908–1940), La Vanguardia (1914–1936) El Pueblo Vasco (1920–1936) or La Nación (1914–1940).His distinctive conservative agnosticism was a rara avis among the Spanish right wing ranks. Salaverría received influences from Charles Maurras; those were reflected in La afirmación española, where Salaverría advocated for a traditionalist and anti-Europeanist brand of nationalism. While sometimes included in the Generation of '98, this labelling is found to be questionable by many. He was a prominent basher of most noventayochistas, directing a campaign against the likes of Joaquín Costa, Miguel de Unamuno and Ramiro de Maeztu, only saving Azorín and Ángel Ganivet from his criticism.He was married to feminist Amalia Galárraga, and they had two daughters, Carmen and Margarita. The latter was Spain's first woman diplomat, serving as a plenipotentiary minister.He died on 28 March 1940 in Madrid. References Bibliography González-Allende, Iker (2009).

Carl Herloßsohn,German writers,Writers,"Carl Herloßsohn or Karl Herloßsohn (actually Borromäus Sebastian Georg Carl Reginald Herloß, 1804–1849) was a German author, journalist and encyclopaedist. Life Herloßsohn was born on 1 September 1804 at the Kleinseite in Prague into a poor background as the son of a tailor. He attended Kleinseite Grammar School from 1813, went to Prague University in 1820 and then to Vienna in 1821 to find a better life there. Zacharias Werner tried in vain to persuade Herloßsohn to join the order of the Redemptorists. Herloßsohn returned to Prague at the beginning of 1822, continued his law studies and published his first poetic works in the Dresden daily, the Dresdner Abend-Zeitung. In November 1823, he became tutor to Johann Prochaska, director of the Propsteigut Dejwitz near Prague, and worked temporarily in the Dejwitz judicial office. In November 1825, he moved to Leipzig to secure his livelihood as a writer. Herloßsohn became a translator, worked for the Brockhaus Literarisches Conversationsblatt, a literary journal, and wrote for various, mainly belletristic, papers. In 1826 his first work was published, Die Fünfhundert vom Blanik, und die Sylvesternacht. In 1830, he founded the magazine Der Komet, ""an entertainment journal for the educated literary world"", which with its numerous supplements (including the Zeitung für Reisen und Reisende, 1830–1836; Der Dampfwagen, 1834; Der Luftballon, 1835–1836; Telescop, 1843–1847) is one of the influential and critical works of literature in the pre-revolutionary period known as the Vormärz. Herloßsohn edited the magazine for nineteen years, finally having to give up in the revolutionary year of 1848. Herloßsohn died impoverished in the St. James' Hospital in Leipzig on 10 December 1849.Herloßsohn wrote numerous poems and songs, some of which became very popular in the 19th century. His poem Wenn die Schwalben heimwärts ziehn was set to music several times including by Robert Schumann. He also wrote numerous novels and short stories, including several historical novels from the period of the Thirty Years' War and the Hussite Wars, which were translated into Czech because of their Hussite-friendly sentiments. His satirical, critical prose is remarkable. Like Wilhelm Hauff, Herloßsohn parodied Heinrich Clauren by publishing the novel Emmy oder der Mensch denkt, Gott lenkt under his name in 1827. He also mocked Clauren's plays in 1827 in Der Luftballon oder die Hundstage in Schilda. His Löschpapiere aus dem Tagebuch eines reisenden Teufels (2 vols., 1827/28) or the almanac Mephistopheles, a political-satirical paperback for the year 1833, published with Johann Peter Lyser, caused a stir.From 1834 to 1838, Herloßsohn published the Damen Conversations Lexikon (10 vols.) together with the publisher von der Lühe. He was able to win over Robert Schumann to edit the musical entries. From 1839 to 1842, he published together with Hermann Marggraff and Robert Blum the Allgemeines Theaterlexicon or encyclopedia of ""everything worth knowing for stage performers, amateurs and theatre fans with the participation of Germany's most knowledgeable writers"" in seven volumes.In Leipzig, a street is named after Herloßsohn, which leads from the district of Gohlis-South to the Rosental area. The small bridge that crosses the Parthe here is called Herloßsohnsteg.

Sugata Bose,Indian writers,Writers,"Sugata Bose (born 7 September 1956) is an Indian historian and politician who has taught and worked in the United States since the mid-1980s. His fields of study are South Asian and Indian Ocean history. Bose taught at Tufts University until 2001, when he accepted the Gardiner Chair of Oceanic History and Affairs at Harvard University. Bose is also the director of the Netaji Research Bureau in Kolkata, India, a research center and archives devoted to the life and work of Bose's great uncle, the Indian nationalist, Subhas Chandra Bose. Bose is the author most recently of His Majesty's Opponent: Subhas Chandra Bose and India's Struggle against Empire (2011) and A Hundred Horizons: The Indian Ocean in the Age of Global Empire (2006). From 2014 to 2019, Bose has served as a Member of India's Parliament from the Jadavpur Constituency in West Bengal with his party affiliation in Mamata Banerjee-led All India Trinamool Congress (TMC). Early life and family Sugata Bose was born in Calcutta, India. After studying at Presidency College, Kolkata, University of Calcutta Bose subsequently completed his PhD at the University of Cambridge before being named a research fellow of St. Catharine's College at Cambridge in 1981.The grandnephew of Indian nationalist Subhas Chandra Bose and grandson of nationalist Sarat Chandra Bose. His father was paediatrician and legslator Sisir Kumar Bose and his mother was educator and legislator Krishna Bose. Bose's brother, Sumantra Bose, teaches at the London School of Economics; his sister, Sarmila Bose, is a researcher at Oxford University. Academic career After completing his PhD at Cambridge, Sugata Bose began his career as a professor of history and diplomacy at Tufts University. In 2001 Bose was appointed to the Gardiner Chair of Oceanic History and Affairs at Harvard University, a position that had lain vacant for almost two decades, one which had been previously occupied by historians of the Western Hemisphere, but one for which Harvard specifically wanted a historian of South Asia. From 2003 to 2010, Bose headed up the university's South Asia initiative as well as the graduate program in the history department. Books In 2011 Bose published His Majesty's Opponent: Subhas Chandra Bose and India's Struggle against Empire, a biography of his great uncle Subhas Bose. The biography, a trade book, has been criticised in scholarly reviews for soft-pedaling or oversimplifying Subhas Chandra Bose's alliances with Italian Fascism, German National Socialism, and Japanese imperialism. The book has also been criticised for its optimistic speculations on what Subhas Bose might have accomplished had he lived. Some popular reviews have been more positive.In his earlier A Hundred Horizons: The Indian Ocean in the Age of Global Empire (2006), Bose attempts to challenge the thesis pioneered by Kirti N. Chaudhuri in Trade and Civilisation in the Indian Ocean: An Economic History from the Rise of Islam to 1750, Cambridge University Press, 1985, ISBN 9780521285421 and developed by Andre Wink and others, which holds that the world's first ""global economy,"" the trans-Indian-ocean maritime economy—whose trade was assisted by the alternating winds and currents of the monsoons and which arose in the wake of the spread of Islam—was in turn undercut by European capitalism in the early 18th century. Instead, Bose contends, in the main thesis of his book, an inter-regional economy of middle-level bazaar merchants and traders continued well into the late 1920s, existing between the dominant European capitalists at the top and the peasants and peddlers at the bottom. This according to Bose, was not just the case in the market of goods and services, but also in the barter of ideas and culture. Attempting to bolster the latter notion are sections in the book on Mohandas K. Gandhi, Rabindranath Tagore, and Bose's great uncle Subhas Chandra Bose. A Hundred Horizons was praised by academic reviewers for explicating the transformations to networks which linked Indian Ocean societies, beyond the influence of colonial empires, and for exploring ""cosmopolitan notions of anticolonialism"" throughout the Indian Ocean world. However, Bose's delineation of that economy has been criticised for not going much beyond India and Indians, for reducing the complex exchange between the British and India to a clash of Indian nationalism and British authoritarianism; and for not providing sufficient warrant for the main thesis in the book.Bose is also the author and editor of books on the economic, social and political history of modern South Asia. Beginning his career with work on the economy of agrarian Bengal, Bose published two volumes on his research. Agrarian Bengal: Economy, Social Structure and Politics, 1919–1947, published in 1986, contextualised rural economic life within the wider currents of the global economy, while a 1993 contribution to the New Cambridge History of India, Peasant Labour and Colonial Capital: Rural Bengal since 1770, analysed two and a half centuries of regional economic and social change. Political career Sugata Bose was a Trinamool Congress MP (2014 -2019) at the 16th Lok Sabha, representing the Jadavpur constituency. Other activities In January 2012, Bose joined New Yorker editor David Remnick, former New York Times editor Joseph Lelyveld and journalist Peter Popham at the sixth Jaipur Literature Festival in a panel on the challenges of biographical writing.Bose has been active in researching, speaking, and publishing on Rabindranath Tagore, contributing to projects across different media. In 2007, Krishna and Sugata Bose co-edited Purabi: the East in its Feminine Gender, a book and CD of Tagore's poetry and music. Bose has produced a four-CD set of Tagore's songs written outside of India as Visva Yatri Rabindranath, and has lectured widely on Tagore in North America, Europe, and Asia.Beyond his work at Harvard and Tufts, Bose has helped steer two major projects advancing higher education in India. Since 2007, Bose has been a member of the Government of India's Nalanda Mentor Group, which seeks to establish an international university on the site of the ancient University of Nalanda in Bihar. Since 2011, Bose has served as chairman of the Presidency College Mentor Group, which seeks to revitalise the 194-year-old Kolkata college. He also served on the Social Sciences jury for the Infosys Prize in 2009, and the Humanities jury in 2015 and 2016. Bibliography Books Bose, Sugata (1986).

Norberto Romualdez,Filipino writers,Writers,"Norberto Romuáldez y López (June 6, 1875 – November 4, 1941), often referred to as Norberto Romuáldez Sr. to distinguish him from his son with the same name, was a Philippine writer, politician, jurist, and statesman. He was the first Lopez-Romuáldez to attain national prominence, and is deemed the ""Father of the Law on the National Language"". He was the eldest son of Doña Trinidad Lopez-Romualdez, the Romualdez grand matriarch, and uncle of First Lady of the Philippines Imelda Romualdez Marcos, the daughter of his youngest brother Vicente Orestes Lopez Romualdez. Biography Born to the prominent Lopez clan of Leyte (originally from Granada in the Andalusian region of Spain), he is the grandson of Spanish friar and silversmith Don Francisco Lopez. Romuáldez grew up in Leyte, where the Lopez family owned vast coconut and abacá plantations, and first achieved status as a writer in the Waray language. His first Waray zarzuela was An Pagtabang ni San Miguel (The Aid of Saint Michael). In 1908, Romuáldez wrote Bisayan Grammar and Notes on Bisayan Rhetoric and Poetic and Filipino Dialectology, a treatise on the grammar of the Waray language. The following year (1909) he founded the Sanghiran san Binisaya ha Samar ug Leyte (Academy of the Visayan Language of Samar and Leyte) for the purpose of promoting and intellectualizing Waray. Romuáldez was also fluent in other languages like Spanish, English, and Cebuano. Romuáldez served as an Associate Justice of the Philippine Supreme Court during the American Period. He was also a participant in the 1934-1935 Constitutional Convention which resulted in the 1935 Constitution for the Philippine Commonwealth. He was later elected as assemblyman from the 4th district of Leyte through a special election in 1936. He was re-elected in 1938. Romuáldez ran for senator in 1941. However, he died on November 4, 1941, a week before the election, after an undisclosed illness. A book written about his niece's life notes that he died of a heart attack in Samar.

Alan Ereira,British writers,Writers,"Alan Ereira is a British author, historian and documentary filmmaker. He is a Professor of Practice at the University of Wales, Trinity St. David. Life Educated at Kilburn Grammar School, Ereira subsequently worked at the BBC on television and radio since 1965 contributing documentaries to the Timewatch strand amongst others He has been awarded the Japan Prize for his 1978 documentary on the Battle of the Somme, and the Royal Television Society Best Documentary Series award for his 1988 documentary on the Armada. Ereira directed a documentary called From the Heart of the World - The Elder Brother's Warning (1990) for the British Broadcasting Corporation. In this film he documented his unique visits to the Kogi people of Colombia, an indigenous ('Indian') ethnic group which survived attempts by the Spanish conquerors to destroy them by retreating high up into the mountainous area of the Sierra Nevada, where they now live. These meetings were only allowed by the Kogi Mamos who normally restrict any direct interaction with the modern world. In Ereira's case, the Mamos made an exception as they saw him as the filmmaker they wanted to convey their message to the world. Ereira regards the Kogi as unique amongst indigenous peoples in the Americas in that they have managed to retain their traditional culture almost entirely intact. Since the 1980s, the Kogi have warned, on the basis of their observation of ecological changes in the Sierra Nevada, that the world is facing an ecological catastrophe. They asked Ereira to make his films about them to warn the rest of the world (and particularly the West) that it needs to radically change its way of living, and its exploitative attitude to the natural world, if it is to avert this catastrophe. Ereira later wrote about the filming of the documentary in his book The Heart of the World (1990). This book has been republished and retitled as The Elder Brothers (1992) and The Elder Brothers' Warning (2009). Aluna is the sequel documentary to The Heart of the World: Elder Brother's Warning and was made by an indigenous film crew and the Kogi Mamos in collaboration with Ereira. This is to be the final warning to the world by the Kogi Mamos, as it is apparent to them that the world did not heed their original warning in the first documentary. Ereira collaborated with Terry Jones on the documentary series Crusades (1995), Terry Jones' Medieval Lives (2004) and Terry Jones' Barbarians (2006), with whom he also co-authored the respective companion books. In 2004 he also presented, wrote and produced a 6-part documentary series on the kings and queens of England for UKTV History.

Svetoslav Minkov,Bulgarian writers,Writers,"Svetoslav Konstantinov Minkov (Bulgarian: Светослав Константинов Минков) (12 February 1902 – 22 November 1966) was a Bulgarian absurdist fiction writer. Biography Minkov was born in Radomir in 1902 in a military family. His older brother Asen died in the Second Balkan War, while his other brother Ivan, a member of the Bulgarian Communist Party, committed suicide in 1925 to evade arrest by the oppressive Tsarist authorities. Minkov received his primary education in Radomir, and graduated from a high school in Sofia. His sister Teodora introduced him to the Bulgarian literary circles of the 1920s. He published his first work - Newton's binomial in the ""Bulgaran"" magazine in 1920. He was later enrolled in a military college in Austria, where he studied the works of Goethe, Nietzsche, Edgar Allan Poe, Henrik Ibsen and the Russian classical authors. Minkov was known for his eccentric character and suffered from bizarre, paranoid phobias, pervasive obsessive thoughts and nightmares.He studied at Sofia University for a brief period of time before departing for Munich in 1922. There he spent some of his best years, paying more attention to contacts with the local bohemians than to studies. He came back to his native country in 1923, and started working as a librarian for the SS. Cyril and Methodius National Library. Before 1942, Minkov visited a number of countries in Europe, Asia and South America. Between 1942 and 1943 he worked in the Bulgarian embassy in Tokyo. After 1944, he began working in a number of Communist-oriented newspapers. From 1954 to 1962 he was a chief editor at the ""Bulgarski pisatel"" printing house. Minkov died in Sofia on November 22, 1966. Style Svetoslav Minkov is considered a pioneer of Bulgarian science fiction. He was a unique figure in Bulgarian literature – his talent and style were largely isolated from the local literary tendencies of the 1920s and 1930s, and he had no followers. His works primarily concern the loss of identity in the technocratic world, social uniformity under the influence of technology, the uncertainty of morality and values and the existential aspects of boredom. Minkov vividly expresses his ideas by means of parody, diabolism, sarcasm and absurdism. He also wrote numerous tales for children, studies on Japanese culture, and translated the tales of Scheherazade into Bulgarian.

Elfie Donnelly,British writers,Writers,"Elfie Donnelly (born January 14, 1950 in London) is a British-Austrian author, who has written numerous books and radio dramas for children. Her major works are Bibi Blocksberg and Benjamin Blümchen. Biography Donnelly spent her early childhood in Rugby in the English Midlands, and moved to Vienna in her later childhood. The daughter of an Irish father and an Austrian mother, she started a career in journalism already in her youth. In Vienna, she worked as a texter in the news agency APA, where her mother had also worked. In 1973 she moved to Berlin, married Peter Lustig and started writing Hörspiele (audio dramas) for children. She won the German prize for youth literature with her first book. In the 1980s, she became a disciple of Indian mystic Osho. At present she lives with her current husband, author Paul Arató, in Ibiza. Donnelly's two grown-up sons live in Austria and America. Works At age 26, Donnelly published her first book: Servus Opa, sagte ich leise, a story of a small boy telling about the death of his grandfather. The book won the German youth literature prize and the Hans-im-Glück prize in 1978. The book about the accompanying TV series won the Adolf Grimme prize in 1979. Two of her most famous series are Benjamin Blümchen (""Benjamin Blossom""), which deal with the adventures of the talking elephant Benjamin and his little friend, the boy Otto, and Bibi Blocksberg, a series about the adventures of a young cheeky witch. Since 1977, Donnelly has written 65 episodes of Benjamin Blümchen and 40 episodes of Bibi Blocksberg. After seven years, she sold the rights to the works and moved to Majorca. The Benjamin Blümchen audio cassettes have sold over 54 million copies. Summer 2007 marked the 30th anniversary of the series. Donnelly has also written the new Hörspiel and book series Elea Eluanda, a story about a disabled girl, who hasn't let her fate put her down, and is accompanied by her Indian friend Ravi and her ""consoling owl"" Ezechiel. Keeping in with Donnelly's style, all episodes of the series have easily recognisable signature sounds or phrases: Ezechiel's Aramba cholé is as ubiquitous in the respective series as Bibi Blocksberg's Hex-hex or Benjamin Blümchen's Töröö. Donnelly also writes poetry. Works for adults In adult literature, Donnelly has written two detective books for Piper Verlag: Kein einziges Wort and Wen der Tod entlässt. Both books star a German-Austrian female funeral parlor owner with a fondness for tango. For unknown reasons, critics have mainly ignored these books. ORF is planning a TV series based on the books. Für Paare verboten, published by Hoffmann und Campe, is a caricature of the tantra therapy scene. Donnelly has also written an amusing travel guide Gebrauchsanweisung für Mallorca (2002). Das Glasauge (Donnelly's autobiography), Wendelburgs Komplott and Die Hühnerleiter ins Nirvana are books-on-demand also available as e-book. Films In 2001, Donnelly wrote the script to the German 2002 film Bibi Blocksberg. In 2003, this was followed by Bibi Blocksberg und das Geheimnis der blauen Eulen with Marie Luise Stahl as Elea as the second major character. In both films, Sidonie von Krosigk played Bibi and Katja Riemann, Ulrich Noethen, Corinna Harfouch had other major roles. In 2005 and 2006, Donnelly wrote the script to a third Bibi Blocksberg film, and together with her husband Paul Arató, she wrote the film scripts Emma Panther and Der kleine Medicus (not finished yet) - both family entertainment films. Also in 2006, Donnelly wrote the script to the romantic dramedy film Töne aller Arten based on the book by Peter Trabert. Currently the author couple Donnelly-Arató are working on a new multimedia character for children. Donnelly has also written the script for the film Apuena.

Pho Hlaing,Burmese writers,Writers,"Pho Hlaing (Burmese: ဘိုးလှိုင်, also spelt Hpo Hlaing) was a Burmese noble and civil servant, best known for his treatise, Rājadhammasaṅgaha (ရာဇဓမ္မသင်္ဂဟ), which proposed sweeping reforms to transform Burma's monarchy into a constitutional monarchy and an early advocate of indigenous democracy. Pho Hlaing was an accomplished writer and wrote a number of important treatises throughout his lifetime, on politics, mathematics and Buddhist philosophy. Names and titles Pho Hlaing was known by a number of titles and names, including the Yaw Atwinwun (ယောအတွင်းဝန်), Shwepyi Atwinwun (ရွှေပြည်အတွင်းဝန်), Wetmasut Myoza (ဝက်မစွပ်မြို့စား), Magwe Myoza (မကွေးမြို့စား) and posthumously called the Yaw Mingyi (ယောမင်းကြီး) and Shwepyi Mingyi (ရွှေပြည်မင်းကြီး). Atwinwun is roughly analogous to 'Minister of the Interior', Myoza is roughly 'Duke', and Mingyi is a title reserved for the monarch or high-ranking ministers. Early life Pho Hlaing was born in 1830 in Ywapale, a small village in Myingyan District in Upper Burma to Thado Minhlakyawhtin (father) and Me Nyein (mother). His father, a royal official (the Lord of Yenangyaung and Minister of Yindaw) at the Konbaung court, had been a minister under King Tharrawaddy, but was killed during a Hluttaw session by the king for alleged disloyalty. Pho Hlaing's great-grandfather was the Minister of Shwepyi (ရွှေပြည်ဝန်ကြီး).During his early formative years, he joined a local monastery, then led by the Kyabo Sayadaw, as a novice monk (samanera). After the assassination of his father in 1845, Pho Hlaing was given up by his widowed mother to Prince Mindon. He was subsequently adopted by King Tharrawaddy's daughter, Mahadevi. He rejoined the monkhood at his patrons' request, and was educated at royal monasteries and spent some time studying under the Supreme Patriarch, the Bagaya Sayadaw. In the aftermath of the 1852 Second Anglo-Burmese War, Princes Mindon and Kanaung fled Amarapura to overthrow their brother, Pagan. Pho Hlaing, then 22, followed them to Shwebo. That same year, King Pagan abdicated the throne. After this time, Pho Hlaing became a close adviser of the now King Mindon. Reign of King Mindon In 1853, Pho Hlaing married Khin Phyu (b. 1833), the daughter of Kyaw U, the Lord of Magwe, who had a distinguished career in the royal service. Pho Hlaing was first appointed as upanissaya (personal assistant) to his father-in-law, who was responsible for the kingdom's foreign affairs. He was also conferred the title Minhlasithu and became the Lord of Yaw (or Yaw Myoza). At the age of 28, Pho Hlaing was promoted to become the Atwinwun of Yaw. After the assassination of Mindon's heir apparent, Prince Kanaung, Pho Hlaing was put charge of managing industrial projects in the kingdom, including 50 factories and workshops and operating the royal mint, as well as disseminating Western technologies. In 1868, he translated a Sanskrit mathematical text, Lilāvati into Burmese. The following year, he compiled Lipidipika, which included a Burmese language system of the telegraphy code, innovated by Pho Hlaing himself. By 1872, he had been awarded to a salwe of 12 strings. During King Mindon's reign, Pho Hlaing was one of the few officials at the royal court to be allowed to dissent with the king.Despite Pho Hlaing's close relationship with Mindon (who treated him like a son) in 1871, Pho Hlaing was stripped of his offices as the Shwepyi Wun and Lord of Wetmasut and placed under house arrest, because he was accused of drinking alcohol (specifically beer) and claiming alcohol consumption was not a sin unless imbibed to the point of drunkenness. During his time in house arrest, he wrote Vimuttirasa (ဝိမုတ္တိရသ, The Taste of Freedom), a comparative religion treatise and philosophical critique of world religions. However, he was reinstated less than 6 months afterward, at the intervention of the Khinmagan Sayadaw.That same year, Pho Hlaing wrote a defining work, a political treatise entitled Mahāsamatavinicchaya (မဟာသမတဝိနိစ္ဆယ, An Analysis of the Head of State), which delineated a social contract between the king and his subjects, as the king did not rule by divine right, but by birthright. In 1875, he wrote Kāyānupassanā (ကာယာနုပဿနာ, Contemplation of the Body), a treatise on anatomy, commissioned by the Princess Lord of Salin. In 1877, he wrote Ten Kinds of Vipassana Insight (ဝိပဿနာဉာဏ်ဆယ်ပါး), commissioned by a high-ranking Buddhist monk. Pho Hlaing also directed the construction of the Atumashi Monastery. In the days leading up to King Mindon's death in 1877, the royal court was in disarray. Rājadhammasaṅgaha and the reign of Thibaw In 1878, soon after the coronation of King Thibaw, Mindon's son, Pho Hlaing published a revolutionary work, a three-part political treatise called the Rājadhammasaṅgaha (ရာဇဓမ္မသင်္ဂဟ, variously rendered Companion of Dhamma for Royalty, A Collection of Norms for Kingship, or Civil Society under Monarchy). This work was heavily influenced by Buddhist teachings, particularly the Seven Aparihāniya Principles, a sermon given by the Gautama Buddha on proper governance and summarised as follows: Consultation of a body Action by consensus Behaviour in accordance with the law Respect for admonishments of superiors No oppression of women Respect for the rites of towns' and villages' spirit guardians Protection of the monkhoodPho Hlaing's treatise essentially proposed a variety of major political and economic reforms to preserve Burmese sovereignty. These included transforming the kingdom's government system into a constitutional monarchy, whereby the king ruled indirectly by social contract, through a bicameral parliament that was represented by both the aristocracy and commoners, and the king had a cabinet of ministers. These proposals were influenced by England's system of government. The economic reforms suggested by Pho Hlaing included restrictions on royal expenditures, salaries for the royal family and aristocracy, establishment of a national banking system, economic incentives for farmers and traders. Pho Hlaing also analyzed the decline of the Burmese population in the kingdom, coming to the conclusion that excessive taxation was forcing many Burmese to migrate to British-occupied Lower Burma. However, Pho Hlaing's treatise was ignored and rejected. Within 50 days of submitting it to Byedaik (Privy Council), Pho Hlaing was summarily dismissed from his offices.The first Burmese lottery was introduced during the Konbaung Dynasty. A national state lottery was first established in 1878 during the reign of King Thibaw Min, in an attempt to raise state revenues. The lottery was the brainchild of Pho Hlaing, who had played the French lottery in Paris. Following ongoing issues with the administration of the lottery, including conflicts of interest, decreased revenues, condemnation against gambling by Buddhist monks, the lottery was ended in 1880.On 12 August 1883, (the sixth waning day of Wagaung 1235 ME), Pho Hlaing died at the age of 53. At his death, Pho Hlaing had the title Thado Mingyi Minhla Mahamingaung Thihathu.

Pandelis Prevelakis,Greek writers,Writers,"Pandelis Prevelakis (Greek: Παντελής Πρεβελάκης, sometimes transliterated Panteles Prevelakes; 18 February 1909 – 15 March 1986) was a Greek novelist, poet, dramatist and essayist—one of the leading Greek prose writers of the ""Generation of the '30s"". Most of his works are set in Crete. Biography He was born in Rethymno, in Crete, on 18 February 1909. He studied philology in Paris and Thessaloniki. From about 1930 he was a friend and agent of the novelist and poet Nikos Kazantzakis, and eventually wrote a biography of him. In 1938 he brought out what is probably his best-known work, The Tale of a Town or The Chronicle of a Town (Το χρονικό μιας Πολιτείας, 1937), a nostalgic depiction of Rethymno from 1898-1924. From 1939 to 1975 he was a professor of art history in the Academy of Arts, Athens. In 1939 he brought out a historical story, The Death of the Medici. After World War II appeared his Wretched Crete: a chronicle of the rising of 1866 (1945); which was followed by the trilogy, The Cretan (1948-1950) (revised edition 1965), which refers to events between 1866 and 1910 and introduces historical characters such as Venizelos. In 1959 he brought out The Sun of Death, in which a boy comes to terms with human mortality. He also wrote four plays, all based on historical themes. Prevelakes died in Ekali, Attica in 15 March 1986. His grave is in Rethymno, in a churchyard near the top of the hill on Kazantzakis Street. There is a statue of him in front of Rethymno's City Hall.

He is considered a gifted author of Myanmar literature in the 20th century.He has written many historical fictions using his creative talent of writing with different views on history, novels based on the life of the Buddha, and a few contemporary novels.

When his grandparents asked him what he wanted, his reply was to buy the whole series of novels called ""Detective U San Shar"". Not only did they buy the novel series but also they then bought 12 volumes of ""His Philosophy"" by Sagaing U Phoe Thin. He once said in an interview that the love and passion for literature rooted in him thanks to the guidance and support of his family and the people around him and he became a civilized man.The works of Bhamaw Tin Aung, Mya Than Tint are said to have influenced him in his early life. He spent his young life studying at several schools in Mandalay. In 1962 he went to Mandalay University and moved to Yangon University to study Philosophy, which he graduated with honours of three subjects in 1968. Then he continued to study to earn a Master's degree.

The novel is a different version of the Ramayana epic, where he plotted the storyline in which he, unlike the original version, depicted Ravana as the protagonist.Afterwards he wrote many novels with historical background of Bagan, Innwa, Taunggoo, Hanthawaddy and Konbaung eras. Apart from the historical novels, he has also written many novels based on the life of the Buddha and several contemporary novels.He has been one of the few writers who deliver most literary speeches both at home and abroad like a few Asian countries for the Myanmar audience. In recent years, he participated in up to about 200 literary events by giving talks in a year.He established a publishing house named 'Lingadipa'. Theatrical career Shwe Daung Nyo, Chit Oo Nyo's father, was one of noted theatrical (or) stage performers and acted as a tutor for traditional male-dance when the school of arts and culture was first opened in 1952. Young Chit Oo Nyo did not learn from his father how to write dramas, play musical instruments systemically but he got familiar with the dialogues, songs, verses used in the field of the theatrical performance when time went by. He said that his father did teach him 'Baby Phoe Sein dance', a type of dance for a boy. Chan Tha, a prominent stage performer, said, ""Chit Oo Nyo is, no doubt, interested in performing arts and his style of dancing implies that he is really crazy about Ramayana dance. His body and hand movements are as well much attractive."" He contributed to Myanmar traditional theatrical field by writing stage dramas, editing Thabin magazine (a theater magazine) from 1983 to 1988, scriptwriting and directing in a theatrical group. Film career Not only have some of his novels been adapted into films but also he has been acting as a scriptwriter and/or shooting manager for many films in the film industry. In the academy-award winning film Thu Kyun Ma Khan Bi (Never shall we be enslaved!) released in 1997, he did the screenplay of the film and was assigned as an art director and production designer as well. He was chosen as one of the scriptwriters for the upcoming film 'Aung San' that is expected to be screened in late 2020.Wu yue chuan qi or Musical Legend, the joint drama TV series between China and Myanmar, is based on a historical story of Pyu Era and the original script was written by Chit Oo Nyo. Lingadipa Chithu Lingadipa Chithu is the most well-known historical novel ever written by him and was first published in 1977. The novel is based on the Ramayana epic story, where Rama is the protagonist. From a different perspective on the main epic story, he wrote a novel of his own, where Ravana (Dassagiri) is the hero and protagonist of the novel.

As an adult, Parsi moved to the United States and studied foreign policy at the Johns Hopkins School for Advanced International Studies, where he received his Ph.D. in International Relations under Francis Fukuyama. Career Early in his career Parsi worked for the Swedish Permanent Mission to the United Nations in New York, where he served in the Security Council, handling the affairs of Afghanistan, Iraq, Tajikistan, and Western Sahara, and on the General Assembly's Third Committee, addressing human rights in Iran, Afghanistan, Myanmar and Iraq.In 2003, Parsi served as an aide to Representative Bob Ney. Parsi has served as an adjunct professor of international relations at Johns Hopkins University SAIS, an adjunct scholar at the Middle East Institute and as a Policy Fellow at the Woodrow Wilson International Center for Scholars in Washington DC.Parsi is an Iranian-Swedish dual national and a permanent resident of the United States. He is fluent in Persian, English, and Swedish.Trita Parsi was awarded the 2016 Alumni of the Year prize from Uppsala University. National Iranian American Council In 2002, Parsi founded the National Iranian American Council (NIAC), whose stated purpose is ""dedicated to strengthening the voice of Iranian-Americans and promoting greater understanding between the American and Iranian people. We accomplish our mission through expert research and analysis, civic and policy education, and community building."" At NIAC's founding, Parsi argued ""Our community is educated, affluent, dynamic, and professionally successful. However, we have yet to harness our immense human potential into constructive engagement in American civil society.""Through NIAC, Parsi supports engagement between the US and Iran, saying it ""would enhance our [U.S.] national security by helping to stabilize the Middle East and bolster the moderates in Iran.""In a 2011 talk sponsored by the Institute for Global Law and Policy at the Harvard Law School, Parsi argued that the conflict between Israel and Iran was not ideological but strategic and geopolitical. In a 2012 article for Salon, Parsi accuses Israel of using ""the threat of war to push the U.S. and EU into passing economic sanctions on Iran"" and denounced those sanctions as ""blind"" and ""indiscriminate."" Lobbying controversy and defamation lawsuit In 2007, Arizona-based Iranian-American blogger Hassan Daioleslam began publicly asserting that NIAC was lobbying on behalf of the Islamic Republic of Iran. Daioleslam wrote in an internal email, ""I strongly believe that Trita Parsi is the weakest part of the Iranian web because he is related to Siamak Namazi and Bob Ney... I believe that destroying him will be the start of attacking the whole web. This is an integral part of any attack on Clinton or Obama.""In response, Parsi sued him for defamation. In September 2012, a U.S. federal judge John D. Bates threw out the libel suit against Daioleslam on the grounds that ""NIAC and Parsi had failed to show evidence of actual malice, either that Daioeslam acted with knowledge the allegations he made were false or with reckless disregard about their accuracy."" Bates also wrote, ""Nothing in this opinion should be construed as a finding that defendant’s articles were true. Defendant did not move for summary judgment on that ground, and it has not been addressed here."" Books Treacherous Alliance In 2007, Yale University Press published Treacherous Alliance: The Secret Dealings of Israel, Iran, and the United States. Parsi's work is an expansion of his 2006 Ph.D. dissertation written at Johns Hopkins University under the supervision of his Ph.D. adviser Francis Fukuyama. The book ""takes a closer look at the complicated triangular relations between Israel, Iran, and the United States that continue to shape the future of the Middle East."" The book argues that the struggle between Israel and Iran is not ideological but strategic. The book received many positive reviews. In Foreign Affairs, L. Carl Brown called the book a ""well-constructed history"" and former U.S. ambassador Peter Galbraith praised the book as ""a wonderfully informative account."" The book was also praised by political scientist John Mearsheimer and former National Security Advisor Zbigniew Brzezinski who was on his dissertation committee. In 2008, Treacherous Alliance was awarded the silver medal (runner-up) in the Council on Foreign Relations' Arthur Ross Book Award.Reviewing the book in Commentary in March 2008, however, Nathan Thrall found it ""troubling"" that a ""litany of praise"" had ""been heaped on this book by authorities in American foreign policy and Middle East studies."" Parsi, noted Thrall, believes that ""the internal dynamics of states (i.e., their ideology, system of governance, ethnic makeup, class structure, and religion), while important, 'have little or no impact on their respective foreign policies.'"" Thrall suggested that in propounding such a thesis, Parsi, ""the head of a lobby promoting 'greater understanding' of Iran,"" may just be ""doing his job. But the distinction between arriving at a conclusion and beginning with one is what separates the work of a historian from that of a lobbyist. In this case, it is a distinction that seems to be lost not only on him but on the luminaries who have lined up to endorse his defective scholarship and tendentious conclusions.""Treacherous Alliance received the 2010 Grawemeyer Award from the University of Louisville, given for ""Ideas Improving World Order."" Treacherous Alliance also won the 2008 Arthur Ross Silver Medallion from the Council on Foreign Relations, which described it as a ""unique and important book"" that ""takes a closer look at the complicated triangular relations between Israel, Iran, and the United States that continue to shape the future of the Middle East.""In a 2011 interview with the Institute for Global Law and Policy at Harvard University, Parsi asserted that his thesis had ""been vindicated"" by recent events. ""I believe it is increasingly clear that efforts to divide the region between moderates vs radicals, democracies vs non-democracies etc is of little utility and has no real explanatory value. Israel, for instance, who had sought to frame its rivalry with Iran as a struggle between the region's sole Western democracy against a fanatical Islamic tyranny, favored the status quo in Egypt and opposed the efforts to oust Mubarak."" He added that ""With the decline of the US, Israel's strategic paralysis and increased isolation in the region, the rise of Turkey, the 'revolutions' in Tunisia and Egypt, and Iran's continued difficulties in translating its strength to regional acceptance, the region is experiencing momentous changes both in its political structure and in its balance of power. An ideology based approach towards understanding these shifts won't get you far."" A Single Roll of the Dice: Obama's Diplomacy with Iran In the 2012 book, Parsi's thesis is that US-Iran relations are in a stalemate caused by institutionalized enmity: ""The thirty-year old US-Iran enmity is no longer a phenomenon; it is an institution."" He argues that the way forth is through sustained diplomacy that he considers ""the only policy that remains largely unexplored and that has a likelihood of achieving results amounting to more than kicking the can down the road.""Julian Borger wrote in The Guardian that A Single Roll of the Dice is ""A carefully balanced and thoroughly researched account of the tortured US-Iranian relationship in recent years."" L. Carl Brown from Foreign Affairs said the book is ""the most incisive account available... eminently readable, sometimes gripping.""Reviewing the book in The Wall Street Journal, Sohrab Ahmari faults Parsi for failing to ""re-examine U.S. policy and its underlying assumptions."" Instead, he writes, ""Quick to ascribe irrationality and bad faith to opponents of engagement, Mr. Parsi is charitable when it comes to examining the motivations of the Iranian side."" In opposition to Parsi's position, Ahmari concludes, ""Mr. Obama's engagement policy failed not because of Israeli connivance or because the administration did not try hard enough. The policy failed because the Iranian regime, when confronted by its own people or by outsiders, has only one way of responding: with a truncheon.""A Single Roll of the Dice: Obama's Diplomacy with Iran was selected by Foreign Affairs as the Best Book of 2012 on the Middle East. Losing an Enemy This book describes in detail the whole course of the extraordinarily complex international negotiation that led to the conclusion in Vienna on July 14, 2015.

Sahar Delijani,Iranian writers,Writers,"Sahar Delijani (Persian: سحر دلیجانی; born 1983) is an Iranian author. Her debut novel, Children of the Jacaranda Tree, has been published in more than 75 countries and translated into 30 languages. Life Sahar Delijani was born in Evin Prison in Tehran while both her parents were detained as leftist political activists, fighting against the newly established Islamic regime. Delijani's mother spent two years and a half in prison and her father four years. Her uncle, her father's younger brother, however, was among thousands of political prisoners executed and buried in mass graves by the regime in 1988.Delijani, her older brother and her cousin were raised by her grandparents and aunt until their parents' release. Much of this experience, inside and outside Evin Prison, serves as an inspiration for Delijani's debut novel, which spans the decades from 1983 to 2011 and the Iranian Green Movement, when young Iranians once again take to the streets, set to make their own history.In 1996, at the age of 12, Delijani and her family moved to Northern California. In 2002, she attended University of California, Berkeley, earning a BA degree in Comparative Literature. Graduating in 2006, she moved to Turin, Italy where she lived for over 10 years. She has moved back to California where she is working on her second novel. Twice a Pushcart nominee and longlisted for the Granum Foundation Prize and Le Livre de Poche Prix des Lecteurs, Delijani's writing has appeared in several literary magazines and newspapers including Literary Hub, Kweli Journal, BBC Persian, The Bellevue Review, Slice Magazine, DW Persian, Corriere della Sera and La Nazione.

Ameen Rihani,Lebanese writers,Writers,"Ameen Rihani (Amīn Fāris Anṭūn ar-Rīḥānī) (Arabic: أمين الريحاني / ALA-LC: Amīn ar-Rīḥānī; Freike, Syria, November 24, 1876 – September 13, 1940), was a Syrian American writer, intellectual and political activist. He was also a major figure in the mahjar literary movement developed by Arab emigrants in North America, and an early theorist of Arab nationalism. He became an American citizen in 1901. Early days Ameen Rihani was born on November 24, 1876, in Freike, Ottoman Syria. Rihani was one of six children and the oldest son of a Maronite raw silk manufacturer, Fares Rihani. In 1888, his father sent him and his brother to New York City. Ameen, then eleven years old, was placed in a school where he learned the rudiments of the English language. His father and uncle, having established themselves as merchants in a small cellar in lower Manhattan, soon felt the need for an assistant who could read and write in English. Therefore, the boy was taken away from school to become the chief clerk, interpreter and bookkeeper of the business. During this time, Ameen made the acquaintance of American and European writers. He eventually became familiar with the writings of Shakespeare, Hugo, Darwin, Huxley, Spencer, Whitman, Tolstoy, Voltaire, Thoreau, Emerson and Byron, to name a few. Ameen had a natural talent in eloquent speaking, and in 1895, the teenager got carried away by stage fever and joined a touring stock company headed by Henry Jewet (who later had his theatre in Boston). During the summer of the same year, the troupe became stranded in Kansas City, Missouri and so the prodigal son returned to his father. However, he returned not to rejoin the business, but to insist that his father give him a regular education for a professional career. They agreed that he should study law. To that end, he attended night school for a year, passed the Regents Exam, and in 1897 entered the New York Law School. A lung infection interrupted his studies, and at the end of his first year, his father had to send him back to Syria to recover. Once back in his homeland, he began teaching English in a clerical school in return for being taught formal Classical Arabic. Rihani had first become familiar with Arab poets in 1897. Among these poets were Abul-Ala Al-Ma’arri, whom Ameen discovered to be the forerunner of Omar Khayyam. In 1899 he returned to New York, having decided to translate some of the quatrains of Al-Ma’arri into English. The first version of the translation was published in 1903. He began writing in English, becoming, according to Lebanese historian Samir Kassir, ""the first Arab to publish in English without at the same time renouncing his own language."" During this period, he joined several literary and artistic societies in New York, such as the Poetry Society of America and the Pleiades Club, and also became a regular contributor to an Arabic daily newspaper, Al-Huda, published in New York. He wrote about social traditions, religion, national politics and philosophy. Thus, he began his extensive literary career, bridging two worlds. He published his first two books in Arabic in 1902 and 1903. In 1905 he returned to his native mountains. During an ensuing six-year period of solitude, he published, in Arabic, two volumes of essays, a book of allegories and a few short stories and plays. Rihani, who was influenced by the American poet Walt Whitman, introduced prose poetry to Arab literature. His new style of poetry was published as early as 1905. This new concept flourished in the Arab world and continued to lead modern Arab poetry after Rihani's death in 1940 and throughout the second half of the 20th century. Additionally, he lectured at the Syrian Protestant College (later the American University of Beirut) and in a few other institutions in other cities of the Arab world such as Damascus, Aleppo, Jerusalem, Cairo, and others. He also worked, along with other national leaders, for the liberation of the Levant from Turkish rule. In 1910 he published Ar-Rihaniyyaat, the book that established him as a forward thinker and a visionary. As a result of Ar-Rihaniyyaat, the Egyptian media hailed him as ""The Philosopher of Freike"". During this same period of mountain solitude The Book of Khalid was written and was later published in 1911 after he returned to New York. The illustrations for this book, which was the first English novel ever written by an Arab, were provided by Khalil Gibran. A reception was held in honor of Rihani for the release of The Book of Khalid and the president of the New York Pleiades Club crowned him with a laurel garland. Established writer in Arabic and English During the period between 1910 and 1922 Rihani became remarkably involved in the literary life while continuing to pursue productive political engagements. On the literary level, he continued writing and publishing in English and Arabic. Among the books that he published during that period were: The Lily of A-Ghor, a novel in English, and (rewritten) in Arabic, describing the oppression of the woman (represented by Mariam) during the Ottoman Empire, Jihan, a novel in English about the role of Levantine women during World War I, The Luzumiyat, translation of the Arabic poetry of Al-Ma’arri into English with Rihani's introduction highlighting the significance of this poet to the Western mind, The Path of Vision, essays in English on East and West, A Chant of Mystics, poetry in English, The Descent of Bolchevism, political analysis in English on the Arab origins of the socialist movements, New Volumes of Ar-Rihaniyyaat, philosophic and social essays in Arabic. In 1916 Ameen married Bertha Case, an American artist, who was part of the Matisse, Picasso, Cézanne and Derain group in Paris, and the Midi, and joined them in exhibiting her work at the Salon de Mai. Bertha visited Lebanon in 1953 (thirteen years after Ameen's death), staying with the family of Rihani's brother, Albert, in Freike. On July 29, 1970, Bertha died in New York at the age of 91. She had requested that her body be cremated and that her ashes be sent to Freike to be buried next to her husband's. Bertha's niece, Sally Storch also became a professional artist.Ameen and his wife Bertha visited Pope Benedict XV in 1917. The Pope was heartedly interested in ending World War I and in establishing an equitable peace between the fighting armies. During that same year, Ameen met with Theodore Roosevelt, former President of the United States, concerning the Palestinian case. In 1919 Rihani was asked to represent Arab interests at the Hague Peace Conference. In 1921 he served as the only Near Eastern member of the Reduction of Armaments Conference in Washington, D.C. During those years he joined another number of literary circles in New York, among which are the Authors’ Club, and the New York Pen League. On the political front, he advocated several causes and worked tirelessly towards these goals: the rapprochement between East and West as a major step towards global cultural dialogue, the liberation of Lebanon from the rule of the Ottoman Empire, and the advocating for Arab nationalism and promoting what he called “The United States of Arabia”. Political and intellectual activist In 1922 Rihani traveled throughout Arabia, meeting and getting better acquainted with its rulers. He was the only traveler at that time, European or Arab, to have covered that whole territory in one trip. He acquired an invaluable and first-hand account of the character, vision and belief of each of these rulers. He developed a friendship with Ibn Saud, ruler of the desert kingdom that would soon become the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia. Between 1924 and 1932 he wrote and published six books in English and Arabic related to the three trips he made to Arabia. These accounts were a considerable critical and public success. London publishers released a circular on Rihani's travel books as having been best sellers. He is considered by some scholars as a major figure in the intellectual development of Arab nationalism. In his writings on national issues, he emphasized the importance of a secular state and a secular education pointing that there must be no minorities or majorities, but only equal citizens. Rihani placed the greatest priority on the spread of nationalist and pro-unity feeling among the masses, and argued that rulers would have to follow. During that time, he also published another four books in Arabic, and delivered numerous speeches in Lebanon, the Arab world, the East and West Coasts of the United States, and in Canada ranging in topics from social reform to politics, Pan-Arabism, East and West cohesion, poetry and philosophy. Rihani also participated in the Arab American movement championing the Arab Palestinian cause. Much of this activity focused on countering the rising influence of the American Zionist lobby, which supported a separate Jewish state in Palestine. He met with various U.S. officials in this regard and, during the 1920s and 1930s, was active on behalf of the Arab American, Palestine Anti-Zionism Society (later renamed the Arab National League). Rihani publicly debated leading figures in the American Zionist movement and published numerous articles critical of political Zionism. During the last eight years of his life, Ameen Rihani wrote the remainder of his books, continued to be active in his political, literary and philosophical endeavors, and maintained close contacts with several political leaders, poets, writers, scholars and artists. Samir Kassir points to Rihani's role in bringing Beirut into intellectual contact with its ""cultural environment as well as the wider world"". Ameen Rihani died at age 64 on September 13, 1940, at 1:00 pm, in his hometown of Freike. The cause of his death was a bicycle accident which resulted in infectious injuries from multiple fractures of the skull. The news of his death was broadcast to many parts of the world. It caused great emotion not only in Lebanon but throughout the Arab world. Representatives of Arab kings and rulers and of foreign diplomatic missions, together with leading poets, writers, and other intellectuals from the Arab World, attended the funeral ceremony. He was laid to rest in the Rihani Family Mausoleum in Freike. Thirteen years after his death, in 1953, his brother Albert established the Ameen Rihani Museum in Freike to honor his legacy. Overview Rihani is the founding father of Arab American literature. His early English writings mark the beginning of a school of literature that is Arab in its concern, culture and characteristic, English in language, and American in spirit and platform. He is the first Arab to write English essays, poetry, novels, short stories, art critiques, and travel chronicles. He published his works in the U. S. during the first four decades of the twentieth century. In this sense, he is the forerunner of American literature written by well known Middle Eastern writers.Rihani is also considered to be the founder of ""Adab Al-Mahjar"" (Immigrant Literature). He is the first Arab who wrote complete literary works, either in Arabic or in English, and published in the U. S. (New York). His writings pioneered the movement of modern Arabic literature that played a leading role in the Arab Renaissance and contemporary Arab thought. Rihani's Arabic book of essays entitled Ar-Rihaniyyaat (1910), endorsed his major philosophic and social beliefs and values that were reflected in his future works. These beliefs were addressed in the essays of this work such as: Who Am I, Religious Tolerance, From Brooklyn Bridge, The Great City, The Spirit of Our Time, The Spirit of Language, In the Spring of Despair, The Valley of Freike, On Solitude, Ethics, The Value of Life, Conducts of Life, Optimism, The Scattered Truth, Trilateral Wisdom, The Most Exalted Prophet, The State of the Future ... This book consecrate Rihani as a controversial writer paving the way for modernity in Arabic literature and contemporary Arab thought. Rihani's first major novel (in English), The Book of Khalid (1911), was considered a pioneering literary work that paved the way for Arab-American literature. It combined reality and fiction, East and West, spiritualism and materialism, the Arabs and the Americans, philosophy and literature, in a style of language where Arabic metaphors and English language structures go together in an attempt to create an abstract line where both languages can almost touch. Khalid, the hero of the novel, descends from Baalbek, from the roots of the Cedars in Lebanon and immigrates all the way to New York where he faces all the contradictions of his Oriental soft background and the harshness of the Occidental severe reality. He dreams of the virtual Great City, thinks of the ideal Empire, and looks for the Superman who combines within himself the spirituality of the East, the art of Europe, and the Science of America. According to several scholars, The Book of Khalid is the foundation of a new literary trend towards wisdom and prophecy that seeks to reconcile matter and soul, reason and faith, together with the Orient and the Occident in an attempt to explicate the unity of religions and represent the unity of the universe. His books on Arabia, written originally in Arabic and in English, represent an alternative perspective to the Orientalist movement by giving the world, for the first time, an objective and analytical description of Arabia from an Arab point of view. These are Maker of Modern Arabia (1928), Around the Coasts of Arabia (1930), and Arabian Peak and Desert (1931). This Arab Trilogy was considered by the publishers in the United States and Europe as best sellers at the time. The author wrote accounts of his travels to Arabia, in Arabic first, and were published under the titles of Muluk-ul Arab (Kings of the Arabs), Tareekh Najd Al-Hadeeth (History of Modern Najd), Qalb-ul Iraq (The Heart of Iraq) and other works on Arabia that were considered to be a remarkably critical and public success. Scholars, at the dawn of the twenty-first century, recognize the role of Rihani in the discourse of civilizations: Nathan C. Funk argues that “Rihani’s approach to intercultural reconciliation emerged gradually, reflecting the maturation of his personal identity. Though he was quick to develop an intellectually critical attitude toward all forms of intolerance rooted in traditional cultures, Rihani did not stop with the celebration of free thinking and the espousal of forms of national unity that renounce religious confessionalism”. Terri DeYoung compares Rihani with Walt Whitman and highlights the fact that: “Walt Whitman attempted to expose the contradictions within a philosophy ... that called for individual liberty and freedom while at the same time permitting slavery ... So too do Rihani’s writings on the questions of whether democratic principles are evenly projected onto both societies – American and Middle Eastern – where he lived and worked, continue to challenge our most cherished assumptions about ourselves”. Geoffrey P. Nash, on the other hand, emphasizes the spirit of modernity in the works of Rihani where his writings: “prompt a diachronic shift to the early twentieth century, the epoch in which Rihani, who has also been designated a prophet, was composing his first essays on cross-cultural literary and political subjects"".

intellectual and political activist.', 'He was also a major figure in the mahjar literary movement developed by Arab emigrants in North America, and an early theorist of Arab nationalism.', 'He became an American citizen in 1901.', 'Early days Ameen Rihani was born on November 24, 1876, in Freike, Ottoman Syria.', 'Rihani was one of six children and the oldest son of a Maronite raw silk manufacturer, Fares Rihani.', 'In 1888, his father sent him and his brother to New York City.', 'Ameen, then eleven years old, was placed in a school where he learned the rudiments of the English language.', 'His father and uncle, having established themselves as merchants in a small cellar in lower Manhattan, soon felt the need for an assistant who could read and write in English.', 'Therefore, the boy was taken away from school to become the chief clerk, interpreter and bookkeeper of the business.', 'During this time, Ameen made the acquaintance of American and European writers.', 'He eventually became familiar with the writings of Shakespeare, Hugo, Darwin, Huxley, Spencer, Whitman, Tolstoy, Voltaire, Thoreau, Emerson and Byron, to name a few.', 'Ameen had a natural talent in eloquent speaking, and in 1895, the teenager got carried away by stage fever and joined a touring stock company headed by Henry Jewet (who later had his theatre in Boston).', 'During the summer of the same year, the troupe became stranded in Kansas City, Missouri and so the prodigal son returned to his father.', 'However, he returned not to rejoin the business, but to insist that his father give him a regular education for a professional career.', 'They agreed that he should study law.', 'To that end, he attended night school for a year, passed the Regents Exam, and in 1897 entered the New York Law School.', 'A lung infection interrupted his studies, and at the end of his first year, his father had to send him back to Syria to recover.', 'Once back in his homeland, he began teaching English in a clerical school in return for being taught formal Classical Arabic.', 'Rihani had first become familiar with Arab poets in 1897.', 'Among these poets were Abul-Ala Al-Ma’arri, whom Ameen discovered to be the forerunner of Omar Khayyam.', 'In 1899 he returned to New York, having decided to translate some of the quatrains of Al-Ma’arri into English.', 'The first version of the translation was published in 1903.', 'He began writing in English, becoming, according to Lebanese historian Samir Kassir, ""the first Arab to publish in English without at the same time renouncing his own language.""', 'During this period, he joined several literary and artistic societies in New York, such as the Poetry Society of America and the Pleiades Club, and also became a regular contributor to an Arabic daily newspaper, Al-Huda, published in New York.', 'He wrote about social traditions, religion, national politics and philosophy.', 'Thus, he began his extensive literary career, bridging two worlds.', 'He published his first two books in Arabic in 1902 and 1903.', 'In 1905 he returned to his native mountains.', 'During an ensuing six-year period of solitude, he published, in Arabic, two volumes of essays, a book of allegories and a few short stories and plays.', 'Rihani, who was influenced by the American poet Walt Whitman, introduced prose poetry to Arab literature.', 'His new style of poetry was published as early as 1905.', ""This new concept flourished in the Arab world and continued to lead modern Arab poetry after Rihani's death in 1940 and throughout the second half of the 20th century."", 'Additionally, he lectured at the Syrian Protestant College (later the American University of Beirut) and in a few other institutions in other cities of the Arab world such as Damascus, Aleppo, Jerusalem, Cairo, and others.', 'He also worked, along with other national leaders, for the liberation of the Levant from Turkish rule.', 'In 1910 he published Ar-Rihaniyyaat, the book that established him as a forward thinker and a visionary.', 'As a result of Ar-Rihaniyyaat, the Egyptian media hailed him as ""The Philosopher of Freike"".', 'During this same period of mountain solitude The Book of Khalid was written and was later published in 1911 after he returned to New York.', 'The illustrations for this book, which was the first English novel ever written by an Arab, were provided by Khalil Gibran.', 'A reception was held in honor of Rihani for the release of The Book of Khalid and the president of the New York Pleiades Club crowned him with a laurel garland.', 'Established writer in Arabic and English During the period between 1910 and 1922 Rihani became remarkably involved in the literary life while continuing to pursue productive political engagements.', 'On the literary level, he continued writing and publishing in English and Arabic.', ""Among the books that he published during that period were: The Lily of A-Ghor, a novel in English, and (rewritten) in Arabic, describing the oppression of the woman (represented by Mariam) during the Ottoman Empire, Jihan, a novel in English about the role of Levantine women during World War I, The Luzumiyat, translation of the Arabic poetry of Al-Ma’arri into English with Rihani's introduction highlighting the significance of this poet to the Western mind, The Path of Vision, essays in English on East and West, A Chant of Mystics, poetry in English, The Descent of Bolchevism, political analysis in English on the Arab origins of the socialist movements, New Volumes of Ar-Rihaniyyaat, philosophic and social essays in Arabic."", 'In 1916 Ameen married Bertha Case, an American artist, who was part of the Matisse, Picasso, Cézanne and Derain group in Paris, and the Midi, and joined them in exhibiting her work at the Salon de Mai.', ""Bertha visited Lebanon in 1953 (thirteen years after Ameen's death), staying with the family of Rihani's brother, Albert, in Freike."", 'On July 29, 1970, Bertha died in New York at the age of 91.', ""She had requested that her body be cremated and that her ashes be sent to Freike to be buried next to her husband's."", ""Bertha's niece, Sally Storch also became a professional artist."", 'Ameen and his wife Bertha visited Pope Benedict XV in 1917.', 'The Pope was heartedly interested in ending World War I and in establishing an equitable peace between the fighting armies.', 'During that same year, Ameen met with Theodore Roosevelt, former President of the United States, concerning the Palestinian case.', 'In 1919 Rihani was asked to represent Arab interests at the Hague Peace Conference.', 'In 1921 he served as the only Near Eastern member of the Reduction of Armaments Conference in Washington, D.C.', 'During those years he joined another number of literary circles in New York, among which are the Authors’ Club, and the New York Pen League.', 'On the political front, he advocated several causes and worked tirelessly towards these goals: the rapprochement between East and West as a major step towards global cultural dialogue, the liberation of Lebanon from the rule of the Ottoman Empire, and the advocating for Arab nationalism and promoting what he called “The United States of Arabia”.', 'Political and intellectual activist In 1922 Rihani traveled throughout Arabia, meeting and getting better acquainted with its rulers.', 'He was the only traveler at that time, European or Arab, to have covered that whole territory in one trip.', 'He acquired an invaluable and first-hand account of the character, vision and belief of each of these rulers.', 'He developed a friendship with Ibn Saud, ruler of the desert kingdom that would soon become the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia.', 'Between 1924 and 1932 he wrote and published six books in English and Arabic related to the three trips he made to Arabia.', 'These accounts were a considerable critical and public success.', ""London publishers released a circular on Rihani's travel books as having been best sellers."", 'He is considered by some scholars as a major figure in the intellectual development of Arab nationalism.', 'In his writings on national issues, he emphasized the importance of a secular state and a secular education pointing that there must be no minorities or majorities, but only equal citizens.', 'Rihani placed the greatest priority on the spread of nationalist and pro-unity feeling among the masses, and argued that rulers would have to follow.', 'During that time, he also published another four books in Arabic, and delivered numerous speeches in Lebanon, the Arab world, the East and West Coasts of the United States, and in Canada ranging in topics from social reform to politics, Pan-Arabism, East and West cohesion, poetry and philosophy.', 'Rihani also participated in the Arab American movement championing the Arab Palestinian cause.', 'Much of this activity focused on countering the rising influence of the American Zionist lobby, which supported a separate Jewish state in Palestine.', 'He met with various U.S. officials in this regard and, during the 1920s and 1930s, was active on behalf of the Arab American, Palestine Anti-Zionism Society (later renamed the Arab National League).', 'Rihani publicly debated leading figures in the American Zionist movement and published numerous articles critical of political Zionism.', 'During the last eight years of his life, Ameen Rihani wrote the remainder of his books, continued to be active in his political, literary and philosophical endeavors, and maintained close contacts with several political leaders, poets, writers, scholars and artists.', 'Samir Kassir points to Rihani\'s role in bringing Beirut into intellectual contact with its ""cultural environment as well as the wider world"".', 'Ameen Rihani died at age 64 on September 13, 1940, at 1:00 pm, in his hometown of Freike.', 'The cause of his death was a bicycle accident which resulted in infectious injuries from multiple fractures of the skull.', 'The news of his death was broadcast to many parts of the world.', 'It caused great emotion not only in Lebanon but throughout the Arab world.', 'Representatives of Arab kings and rulers and of foreign diplomatic missions, together with leading poets, writers, and other intellectuals from the Arab World, attended the funeral ceremony.', 'He was laid to rest in the Rihani Family Mausoleum in Freike.', 'Thirteen years after his death, in 1953, his brother Albert established the Ameen Rihani Museum in Freike to honor his legacy.', 'Overview Rihani is the founding father of Arab American literature.', 'His early English writings mark the beginning of a school of literature that is Arab in its concern, culture and characteristic, English in language, and American in spirit and platform.', 'He is the first Arab to write English essays, poetry, novels, short stories, art critiques, and travel chronicles.', 'He published his works in the U. S. during the first four decades of the twentieth century.', 'In this sense, he is the forerunner of American literature written by well known Middle Eastern writers.', 'Rihani is also considered to be the founder of ""Adab Al-Mahjar"" (Immigrant Literature).', 'He is the first Arab who wrote complete literary works, either in Arabic or in English, and published in the U. S. (New York).', 'His writings pioneered the movement of modern Arabic literature that played a leading role in the Arab Renaissance and contemporary Arab thought.', ""Rihani's Arabic book of essays entitled Ar-Rihaniyyaat (1910), endorsed his major philosophic and social beliefs and values that were reflected in his future works."", 'These beliefs were addressed in the essays of this work such as: Who Am I, Religious Tolerance, From Brooklyn Bridge, The Great City, The Spirit of Our Time, The Spirit of Language, In the Spring of Despair, The Valley of Freike, On Solitude, Ethics, The Value of Life, Conducts of Life, Optimism, The Scattered Truth, Trilateral Wisdom, The Most Exalted Prophet, The State of the Future ...', 'This book consecrate Rihani as a controversial writer paving the way for modernity in Arabic literature and contemporary Arab thought.', ""Rihani's first major novel (in English), The Book of Khalid (1911), was considered a pioneering literary work that paved the way for Arab-American literature."", 'It combined reality and fiction, East and West, spiritualism and materialism, the Arabs and the Americans, philosophy and literature, in a style of language where Arabic metaphors and English language structures go together in an attempt to create an abstract line where both languages can almost touch.', 'Khalid, the hero of the novel, descends from Baalbek, from the roots of the Cedars in Lebanon and immigrates all the way to New York where he faces all the contradictions of his Oriental soft background and the harshness of the Occidental severe reality.', 'He dreams of the virtual Great City, thinks of the ideal Empire, and looks for the Superman who combines within himself the spirituality of the East, the art of Europe, and the Science of America.', 'According to several scholars, The Book of Khalid is the foundation of a new literary trend towards wisdom and prophecy that seeks to reconcile matter and soul, reason and faith, together with the Orient and the Occident in an attempt to explicate the unity of religions and represent the unity of the universe.', 'His books on Arabia, written originally in Arabic and in English, represent an alternative perspective to the Orientalist movement by giving the world, for the first time, an objective and analytical description of Arabia from an Arab point of view.', 'These are Maker of Modern Arabia (1928), Around the Coasts of Arabia (1930), and Arabian Peak and Desert (1931).', 'This Arab Trilogy was considered by the publishers in the United States and Europe as best sellers at the time.', 'The author wrote accounts of his travels to Arabia, in Arabic first, and were published under the titles of Muluk-ul Arab (Kings of the Arabs), Tareekh Najd Al-Hadeeth (History of Modern Najd), Qalb-ul Iraq (The Heart of Iraq) and other works on Arabia that were considered to be a remarkably critical and public success.', 'Scholars, at the dawn of the twenty-first century, recognize the role of Rihani in the discourse of civilizations: Nathan C.

Therese Bohman,Swedish writers,Writers,"Therese Bohman (born August 21, 1978) is a Swedish novelist and cultural journalist. Life Bohman grew up in Kolmården, a town about 150 km south of Stockholm that is famous for its zoo, the Kolmården Wildlife Park. She has written that she visited the Kolmården zoo frequently as a child.Bohman is an editor for a monthly magazine called Axess, and is also an art critic for the Swedish newspaper Expressen. In addition to her work for those publications, Bohman is a freelance writer about art, literature and fashion.In 2010, Bohman's debut novel, Drowned, was published in Sweden and it was subsequently translated and published in France, Germany, Holland, Australia, New Zealand and the United States. Drowned was recommended by Oprah's Book Club. Interests and influences Bohman has stated that her favorite author is Michel Houellebecq. Bohman said that Houellebecq's male protagonists ""are cynical, bitter, even misogynic, but I feel a kind of tenderness for them, and I also feel that I understand them."" Bohman has also said she is a ""big fan"" of Karl Ove Knausgaard.As an art critic, Bohman has said that her artistic interests are similar to those of Kristina, the protagonist of her novel Eventide, in that she prefers nineteenth century, decadent and fin de siècle art, and is especially interested in how women are depicted in such works: It is such a fascinating period of history with big changes in society and culture: Darwin’s theories on evolution changed the way people thought about themselves and about God, secularization, urbanization, the women’s and labour movements, a little later Freud and his theories about the unconscious. All these things made traces in the art from the period, and they are evident in the way women were depicted. Critical Reception Tara Cheesman-Olmsted reviewed Bohman's first two novels, Drowned and The Other Woman, in The Quarterly Conversation. Cheesman-Olmsted found remarkable similarities between the two works: ""The books share so much in common that they might be the same novel: both explore almost identical situations, share many of the same structural and plot devices, and the author’s and translator Marlaine Delargy’s prose styles remain the same from book to book.""The key similarity of Drowned and The Other Woman, Cheesman-Olmsted writes, is that they feature protagonists entangled with older men. Bohman, she writes, ""channels the psyches of twenty-something University students engaged in liaisons with men already involved with other women…. Bohman’s treatment of them is inarguably sympathetic. Their affairs with men may be the impetus for coming-of-age journeys, but they do not represent a final destination.""Cheesman-Olmsted is laudatory of both novels, writing, ""Therese Bohman strikes the right balance between lavish prose and simple storytelling—allowing her books to be both beautiful literary objects and vehicles which engage readers through larger ideas.""Writing in the Los Angeles Review of Books, Randy Rosenthal praised Eventide as ""full of damn fine writing, but it’s the novel’s irreverent attitude toward feminism that makes it as challenging as it is necessary to read."" Rosenthal noted that the main character, Karolina, was ""well drawn,"" but questioned whether the novel could be sustained by the scant plot. Rosenthal concluded that ""Karolina lives by her own terms, and that alone is a courageous kind of success.""Publishers Weekly described Eventide as ""moving,"" going on to say that ""[t]his psychologically rich journey provides insight into an intelligent, successful woman who burns with needs she fears she can’t fulfill."" Kirkus Reviews called Bohman ""an adroit novelist,"" and concluded in its review of Eventide by saying that the book is ""[i]ntelligent, impassioned, and compelling ...

Geoff Gallop,Australian writers,Writers,"Geoffrey Ian Gallop (born 27 September 1951) is an Australian academic and former politician who served as the 27th Premier of Western Australia from 2001 to 2006. He is currently a professor and director of the Graduate School of Government at the University of Sydney and former chairman of the Australian Republican Movement. Born in Geraldton, Western Australia, Gallop studied at the University of Western Australia, and later progressed to St John's College at the University of Oxford after winning a Rhodes Scholarship. Having joined the Labor Party in 1971, he served as a councillor for the City of Fremantle between 1983 and 1986, and was elected to the seat of Victoria Park in the Western Australian Legislative Assembly at the 1986 state election. Having held several portfolios in the preceding Lawrence Ministry (including Minister for Education), Gallop replaced Jim McGinty as Leader of the Opposition in 1996 following McGinty's resignation. At the 1996 election, Labor was defeated by the incumbent Liberal Party led by Richard Court despite a rise in Labor's share of the vote, but he remained as the party's leader, and at the 2001 election Labor was elected to government, with Gallop becoming premier. Having successfully contested the 2005 election, Gallop resigned as Premier, Labor leader and from parliament in early 2006 to aid his recovery from depression, and was replaced by Alan Carpenter. Early life, education and pioneer family Gallop was born and educated in Geraldton. He then entered The University of Western Australia (UWA) in 1969 to study economics. He joined the Labor Party in 1971, and was awarded a Rhodes Scholarship in 1972. In 1974 he studied Philosophy, Politics, and Economics at St John's College, Oxford where he met and became close friends with Tony Blair. Blair is the godfather of Gallop's son Tom, and Gallop was a groomsman at Blair's 1980 wedding. He is also a long-time friend of former federal Labor Leader Kim Beazley. Gallop subsequently received a doctorate of philosophy (DPhil) from Oxford in 1983.Before entering state politics, Gallop worked as a tutor and lecturer at both Murdoch University and The University of Western Australia, and was a City Councillor at Fremantle from 1983 to 1986.Gallop's family was among the first pioneer settlers to the new Swan River Colony now known as Perth in Western Australia. His great-great-grandfather, James Gallop arrived in the Swan River Colony in 1829 the year of the colony's founding. At the age of 18 James, along with two brothers – 20-year-old Richard and 15-year-old Edward – left a Thakeham, West Sussex workhouse. The Gallop brothers left the small village of Thakeham in West Sussex along with several other families from Thakeham and the nearby villages of Sullington and Storrington. Several of these migrants later inter-married: James' son also named James married Emma Woods daughter of George Woods who also came out from Thakeham with his brother John and nephew Jesse Woods. Edward Gallop later drowned but James and Richard became pioneering market gardeners and vignerons. Two homes, Gallop House and Dalkeith House, are heritage-listed legacies of the family's prominence. The brothers were part of a clearing-out of the parishes in the aftermath of the Napoleonic wars. As Greenfield wrote ""The 1820s were very difficult years for agricultural workers and great poverty prevailed, owing partly to the demobilization of soldiers following the end of the Napoleonic Wars, and partly to the high cost of bread due to the Corn Laws. Sullington seems to have been particularly hard hit. ... Emigration was encouraged throughout West Sussex to relieve the parishes of the burden of excessive poor relief. “: 57  The Gallop brothers were among those who chose Australia instead of America: ""West Australia was still very much in the pioneering stage. Letters from emigrants to their friends and relations in this neighbourhood give the impression that those who sailed to America, provided they were not afraid to work, had an easier life than those who took the greater risk and went to Australia"".: 58 Politics Gallop was elected to the Western Australian Legislative Assembly for the seat of Victoria Park in 1986. From 1990 to 1993, during the Lawrence Labor Government, Gallop held portfolios including Education, Parliamentary and Electoral Reform, Fuel and Energy, Micro-Economic Reform, and Minister assisting the Treasurer. The Lawrence government was defeated at the 1993 state elections, and Gallop was elected Deputy Leader of the State Parliamentary Labor Party. Opposition Leader In Opposition, his Shadow Ministerial responsibilities included Treasury, Resources and Energy, Parliamentary and Electoral Reform, Public Sector Management, Accountability, Sport and Recreation, Aboriginal Affairs, Health, Federal Affairs, Treasury and the South West.In October 1996, Jim McGinty resigned as Leader of the Opposition and named Gallop his successor, a role he assumed without a caucus vote. Soon afterwards, he led Labor into an election held in December. He was heavily defeated by the Liberal Party government of Richard Court, taking only 35.8 percent of the primary vote—its lowest total since 1901. In government At the February 2001 state election, Gallop led the Labor Party to victory, taking 13 seats from the Liberals on a seven-percent swing—the largest swing against a sitting government in the state since 1911.Gallop became Premier and Minister for Public Sector Management, Federal Affairs, Science, Citizenship and Multicultural Interests. Gallop went on to win a second term at the 26 February 2005 state election.

Xu Xu,Hong Kong writers,Writers,"Xu Xu, aka Hsu Yu (徐訏), was the pen name of Xu Boxu (徐伯訏; 11 November 1908 – 5 October 1980), an important figure in modern Chinese literature. Born in Cixi in the coastal province of Zhejiang, Xu Xu attended Peking University between 1927 and 1932 where he studied philosophy and psychology. In 1932, he moved to Shanghai where he became an associate of Lin Yutang, a liberal and polyglot intellectual who ran a number of successful literary journals. In 1950, Xu Xu left the newly founded People's Republic of China for Hong Kong where he stayed for the rest of his life. Best known as the author of the modern gothic tale Ghost Love (鬼戀, 1937) or his wartime spy-epic The Rustling Wind (風蕭蕭, 1944), Xu Xu was also a prolific poet, playwright, essayist, literary critic, journal editor, and professor of literature. Many of his popular novels were turned into movies or TV series in post-war Hong Kong and Taiwan. As a writer, editor, and educator, Xu Xu has had a formative impact on a younger generation of post-war writers emerging in Hong Kong and Taiwan. In much of his fiction, and especially in his later works from Hong Kong, Xu Xu explored reality-defying experiences and displayed neo-romantic tendencies, such as aesthetic escapism and mysticism, which place him in the proximity of other modern artists associated with the global revival of romanticism in the 20th-century. Early career In the 1930s, Xu Xu worked as an editor for several of Lin Yutang's journal ventures in Shanghai, such as the bi-monthlies The Analects (論語) and This Human World (人間世), two journals that published predominantly prose essays (小品文). In 1936, Xu Xu went to Paris to study Philosophy at the Sorbonne. In early 1937, while still abroad, his novella Ghost Love in which a modern urbanite falls in love with a woman who claims to be a ghost appeared in the Shanghai bi-monthly Celestial Winds (宇宙風) to great acclaim. Later that year, Xu Xu hastily returned to China following the outbreak of war with Japan. From the relative safety of the Shanghai International Settlement, Xu Xu continued to publish largely apolitical fiction and travel essays that were characterized by lyrical exoticism and a distinctly cosmopolitan outlook. When all of Shanghai was occupied by Japanese forces in the wake of the attack on Pearl Harbor in 1941, Xu Xu left Shanghai for Chongqing, the wartime capital of the Chinese Nationalist government. Here, Xu Xu's wartime novel The Rustling Wind was serialized in the wartime newspaper Enemy Annihilation (掃蕩報) in 1943. An epic about espionage and romance in occupied Shanghai, The Rustling Wind made Xu Xu one of the most widely read authors of the war years. Post-war period Throughout the 1930s and 1940s, Xu Xu's fiction had frequently been criticized by leftist critics as escapist and detrimental to their revolutionary agenda. As a result, Xu Xu decided to leave the newly founded People's Republic of China in 1950 for Hong Kong. In Hong Kong, Xu Xu continued his writing career and throughout the 1950s published dozens of short stories and novellas, most of which appeared in the literary supplements of the Hong Kong newspapers Sing Tao Daily or Sing Tao Evening News. In many of these works, Xu Xu engaged with the themes of exile and alienation and frequently explored fantastic or sublime experiences, as is the case in the novellas Bird Talk (鳥語, 1950) or The Other Shore (彼岸, 1951). Between 1956 and 1961, Xu Xu published his magnum opus, the bildungsroman River of Fury (江湖行) that, in 1972, was turned into a martial arts movie under the same name by Shaw Brothers Studio. In Hong Kong, Xu Xu also wrote copious amounts of literary criticism, edited a number of literary journals, and taught Chinese literature, eventually chairing the Chinese Department of Hong Kong Baptist University. According to Leung Ping-kwan, Xu Xu had a formative impact on a younger generation of Hong Kong writers and intellectuals. In 2018, an operatic version of Xu Xu's novella Ghost Love opened in Hong Kong. References External links Capsule biography from Renditions Further reading Xu Xu, Frederik H. Green (tr.).

Malcolm McKay (writer),British writers,Writers,"Malcolm McKay (born 12 July 1947) is a British writer and director. Early life McKay was born in Epping, London. He studied at St Joseph's Convent primary, King Edward V1 Grammar, Chelmsford and Canley College of Education, Coventry. He qualified as a teacher in 1969 and began a career in the theatre soon after. Novels He has published four novels: The Path, about the personal, intellectual and spiritual inter-reaction between a group of international travelers on the Camino de Santiago; The Lack Brothers, a journey by three brothers in search of their mother through a mythologised London of the last fifty years, published by Transworld; Breaking Up, depicting the financial and interior collapse of a city trader as his domestic and professional life literally goes up in flames, published by Pegasus; Thistown, a political novel for teenagers set in a mythical town somewhere in the universe which is impossible to escape from and where no-one gets older. Television McKay has spent many years as a writer and director for television. His writing has always dealt with extreme behaviour and includes the controversial BBC play Airbase which dealt metaphorically with drug abuse on a USAF base in England. The play achieved notoriety after it was mentioned in Parliament and the Lords after Prime Minister Thatcher demanded a copy, the Chairman of the BBC, Marmaduke Hussey publicly apologised for the content, and Mary Whitehouse, of the National Viewers' and Listeners' Association, issued a second apology to President Reagan on the behalf of the British people. McKay's work also includes the award winning A Wanted Man trilogy (Royal Television Society, best serial, Golden Chest Awards, best drama) one of the first television dramas to deal in depth with the arrest, trial and psychology of a serial killer. The Interrogation of John about the police questioning of a murder suspect (first shown in 1987) becomes the first part of the trilogy; the second part, The Secret, is about his trial; and Shoreland about his subsequent treatment concludes the trilogy.He has made three films for the BBC as writer and director: Redemption, about a child killer, Maria's Child, the graphic description of a female dancer’s decision to abort her child and the subsequent doubts and difficulties of the process, and Cruel Train, an adaptation of Émile Zola's La Bete Humaine. He has also directed plays by Jim Cartwright and Jimmy McGovern again for the BBC. Most recently he adapted Mervyn Peake's Gormenghast trilogy (winner New York Critics Circle award) and wrote an eight part cop show for BBC One. Radio His radio play Etian about a woman's recovery from rape was nominated for a Prix Italia award. Theatre McKay has written many plays for the theatre including Yellowbacks, a dystopian take on the AIDS epidemic; Harry Mixture about a South London gangster; Pistols which describes the final hours of the punk band; Renaissence, an insight into the mental collapse of a lawyer as his family breaks up around him; The People's Temple details the slow descent of the Californian cult into paranoia and mass suicide; Forgotten Voices, an adaptation of the best-selling oral history of the first world war for the Edinburgh Festival.

Tony Cornell,British writers,Writers,"Anthony Donald Cornell (born 1924, died 10 April 2010, aged 86) was a British parapsychologist and prominent figure in the investigations of ghosts and other paranormal activity across the United Kingdom during the later part of the twentieth century. He appeared in numerous TV documentaries and television debates, and was often the subject of magazine and news articles concerning ghosts and paranormal investigations. Biography Cornell was a leading British expert in parapsychology. With his fellow researchers he attempted to record and measure paranormal events using equipment specifically made for the purpose, incorporating off-the-shelf computing and audio/visual capture devices long before the digital era. Cornell and his associates at the Society for Psychical Research pioneered the study of paranormal activities in the UK and paved the way for subsequent investigations. Tony Cornell was born in Histon, Cambridgeshire in 1924 and educated at The Perse School and Fitzwilliam College, Cambridge, then called Fitzwilliam House, from which he graduated in 1949. Tony joined the SPR in 1952, was elected to Council in 1962 and became Vice-President in 1992. Elected Treasurer in 1980, he resigned in 2003, having held the post for 22 years. During this time he focused mainly on investigating hauntings, poltergeists and mediums. With Alan Gauld and Howard Wilkinson he created SPIDER (Spontaneous Psychological Incident Recorder). Many cases were monitored, photographically and electronically, but little significant evidence was obtained in twenty years of its use. In 1971, he visited Russian parapsychologists in Leningrad and Moscow to discuss their telepathy experiments. Mainly interested in apparitions, poltergeists and mediums, Cornell acquired a reputation for trying to get to the bottom of what was going on in a measured and unemotional way, a far cry from the current sensationalistic approach apparent in current media offerings which seem more geared towards entertainment than fact finding. Cornell was a member of CUSPR (Cambridge University Society for Psychical Research) and was appointed Research Officer in 1958 and President in 1968. As the SPR Treasurer and ongoing CUSPR President, he served on the organising committee for the SPR Centenary Conference, held at Trinity College in 1982. Cornell was the author of numerous papers on ghosts and poltergeists and expressed some cautious opinions on the Scole, SORRAT Min-lab (USA) and Enfield cases. He co-authored Poltergeists with Alan Gauld (Routledge & Kegan Paul, London, 1979) and his last major work was Investigating the Paranormal (Helix Press, New York, 2002). By far his most pressing concern was the continued lack of any new knowledge gained about their cause in recent investigations, which have been conducted in an almost identical way for the last 125 years. Cornell was also an amateur antiquarian and helped ensure the preservation of a number of old, timber-framed buildings opposite the Round Church in central Cambridge. Despite the focus of his career, Cornell's most enduring legacy may well be the Cambridge Science Park, which he proposed in the late sixties.Cornell retired from active paranormal investigations after suffering a stroke in 2004. He died peacefully at home in the company of Martin, his second son and Alison, his third wife, on Saturday 10 April 2010. A memorial service was held in the chapel of Fitzwilliam College on 20 June and his ashes scattered in Histon pond during the late evening of 22 June 2010. Research Cornell spent over 50 years investigating the paranormal and came to the conclusion that most paranormal cases turn out to have natural explanations such as the result of fraud, pranks and misidentification. He believed that many sightings of ghosts, hauntings and poltergeists are products of the human mind. Cornell estimated that of the 800 cases that he investigated, only twenty percent were difficult to explain and only a handful were paranormal.Cornell wrote that there is no evidence for the spiritualist hypothesis and most séance room phenomena can be explained by unconscious and deliberate fraud. He wrote that discarnate spirits in trance mediumship are secondary personalities from the mediums subconscious and that all physical mediumship such as ectoplasm is the result of fraud and trickery, however, he believed psychokinesis and telepathy to be real. According to Cornell ""without the presence of a living person, none of the alleged paranormal effects occur."" Throughout his career as a parapsychologist Cornell exposed a number of fraudulent mediums including Rita Goold and Alec Harris. The psychologist and skeptic Richard Wiseman has noted that Cornell conducted a ""great deal of fascinating work"". He investigated the reliability of eyewitness testimony for ghosts by dressing up as a fake spirit in several locations in Cambridge. Cornell discovered that the eyewitness reports were often far from accurate and unreliable. Publications Poltergeists [with Alan Gauld] (Routledge & Kegan Paul, London, 1979) Investigating the Paranormal (Helix Press, New York, 2002). Quotes I take the view that the most nonsensical aspect of much of the physical phenomena in the seance room is the implicit notion that the discarnate resort to such ludicrous, absurd, and facile physical effects to prove that there is life after death. If, as claimed, life in the next world is more advanced than that on earth, one might be forgiven to expect proof of a more intelligent type than what appears acceptable to both the dead and the living, night after night, in the seance room. The shaking of tables and banging of tambourines, the creation of cold breezes and touches, trumpets cavorting and prancing about the room banging the heads of the sitters, and all the other antics that go on in the dark say little for the proficiency of the alleged discarnate visitors. If the ""spirits"" have been capable of such a momentous feat as surviving bodily death transcending time and manipulating matter in this world while existing in another dimension of time and space – why do they not materialize in the seance room something really worth the effort?

'Cornell was a member of CUSPR (Cambridge University Society for Psychical Research) and was appointed Research Officer in 1958 and President in 1968.', 'As the SPR Treasurer and ongoing CUSPR President, he served on the organising committee for the SPR Centenary Conference, held at Trinity College in 1982.', 'Cornell was the author of numerous papers on ghosts and poltergeists and expressed some cautious opinions on the Scole, SORRAT Min-lab (USA) and Enfield cases.', 'He co-authored Poltergeists with Alan Gauld (Routledge & Kegan Paul, London, 1979) and his last major work was Investigating the Paranormal (Helix Press, New York, 2002).', 'By far his most pressing concern was the continued lack of any new knowledge gained about their cause in recent investigations, which have been conducted in an almost identical way for the last 125 years.', 'Cornell was also an amateur antiquarian and helped ensure the preservation of a number of old, timber-framed buildings opposite the Round Church in central Cambridge.', ""Despite the focus of his career, Cornell's most enduring legacy may well be the Cambridge Science Park, which he proposed in the late sixties."", 'Cornell retired from active paranormal investigations after suffering a stroke in 2004.', 'He died peacefully at home in the company of Martin, his second son and Alison, his third wife, on Saturday 10 April 2010.', 'A memorial service was held in the chapel of Fitzwilliam College on 20 June and his ashes scattered in Histon pond during the late evening of 22 June 2010.', 'Research Cornell spent over 50 years investigating the paranormal and came to the conclusion that most paranormal cases turn out to have natural explanations such as the result of fraud, pranks and misidentification.', 'He believed that many sightings of ghosts, hauntings and poltergeists are products of the human mind.', 'Cornell estimated that of the 800 cases that he investigated, only twenty percent were difficult to explain and only a handful were paranormal.', 'Cornell wrote that there is no evidence for the spiritualist hypothesis and most séance room phenomena can be explained by unconscious and deliberate fraud.', 'He wrote that discarnate spirits in trance mediumship are secondary personalities from the mediums subconscious and that all physical mediumship such as ectoplasm is the result of fraud and trickery, however, he believed psychokinesis and telepathy to be real.', 'According to Cornell ""without the presence of a living person, none of the alleged paranormal effects occur.""', 'Throughout his career as a parapsychologist Cornell exposed a number of fraudulent mediums including Rita Goold and Alec Harris.', 'The psychologist and skeptic Richard Wiseman has noted that Cornell conducted a ""great deal of fascinating work"".', 'He investigated the reliability of eyewitness testimony for ghosts by dressing up as a fake spirit in several locations in Cambridge.', 'Cornell discovered that the eyewitness reports were often far from accurate and unreliable.', 'Publications Poltergeists [with Alan Gauld] (Routledge & Kegan Paul, London, 1979)', 'Investigating the Paranormal (Helix Press, New York, 2002).', 'Quotes I take the view that the most nonsensical aspect of much of the physical phenomena in the seance room is the implicit notion that the discarnate resort to such ludicrous, absurd, and facile physical effects to prove that there is life after death.', 'If, as claimed, life in the next world is more advanced than that on earth, one might be forgiven to expect proof of a more intelligent type than what appears acceptable to both the dead and the living, night after night, in the seance room.', 'The shaking of tables and banging of tambourines, the creation of cold breezes and touches, trumpets cavorting and prancing about the room banging the heads of the sitters, and all the other antics that go on in the dark say little for the proficiency of the alleged discarnate visitors.', 'If the ""spirits"" have been capable of such a momentous feat as surviving bodily death transcending time and manipulating matter in this world while existing in another

Pat Mullen,Irish writers,Writers,"Pat Mullen (17 April 1883 - 16 December 1972) was an Irish actor and writer, born in Inishmore, County Galway where before emigrating to Boston, Massachusetts in 1905. He married his first wife Bridget McDonagh in 1913 before returning home to Inishmore with his son Patrick in 1921. Mullen played the part of Shark Hunter in Robert J. Flaherty's Man of Aran (1934) a fictional documentary on life in the Aran Islands. He married his second wife Florence Hall in 1949 before moving to Anglesey, Wales where he died in 1972. Early life Patrick C Mullen was born in Inishmore of the Aran Islands, County Galway to John Mullen and Mary Costello. He grew up in a relatively large family (household size of 12 compared with the regional average of 5.09). He had nine siblings: John, Mary Cecelia (Cissie), Martin, Peter, Joseph, Winnie, Bartly, Michael and Thomas. Mullen attended Kilronan national school on Inishmor until he was fifteen, and worked for his father on the family farm before labouring on the ice boats in Killarney Harbour for two years.Due to the Great Famine of 1845, depletion of farmland, industrial underdevelopment and the collapse of the linen industry along with numerous other factors: the inheritance system among landowners in Ireland (particularly in the West of Ireland) changed from the partible inheritance system to the impartible inheritance system. Land was no longer divided among heirs but instead was appointed to the eldest male. As Patrick was the second eldest male (preceded by John, three years his senior) his options included: remaining in Inishmore with little chance of land ownership, moving to Dublin or another large city in search of employment, or emigrating. Mullen emigrated in 1905 at the age of 21. Family life In Boston he met Bridget McDonough (1882 - 1948) also a Galway native, and married her on 12 October 1913 in Boston, Suffolk, Massachusetts, she was a widow. Bridget was the fourth child to Martin McDonagh and Barbara O'Toole. Bridget was previously married and had four children: Mary Kate, Anna, Denis and Francis Michael with her husband Patrick Crowe also from Galway. The pair lived in Eyre Street in Galway where they had their first child Mary Kate and lived with and a boarder who was a widowed army pensioner. They emigrated to Boston in 1904. Patrick Crowe died suddenly on 29 April 1913, and was buried in St. Joseph Cemetery.They lived in Boston Ward 9 where they kept a boarding house, run by Bridget. They had four children together, Barbara, John, Joseph and Winifred, yet only three of their children survived past infancy, with John living only a week after his birth. The couple lived with their remaining children in Boston and then in Manhattan, until his two brothers Thomas and Bartly fell ill in 1921, compelling him to return to the family home. The brothers died the same year. Returning to Ireland he took his son P.J. who was four at the time, but Bridget did not follow, and their relationship deteriorated thereafter. His daughter Barbara however joined him in Ireland (around 15 years later). Career Having emigrated to Boston in 1905, Mullen began working in factories and warehouses, during the winter months and spent summers on rural contract-labour teams. Having successfully led a strike in a Boston wool-house, he earned a charter from the American Federation of Labour and became a founder in a union of city-wide wool-house workers in 1916. Following this, he met a fellow emigrant James Larkin, who was an Irish labour leader, having joined the James Connolly Socialist Club. Mullen’s trade-union activism lead him to be sacked from several jobs and blacklisted by employers in Boston, turning him to engage in illegal liquor trafficking. Mullen then returned home in 1921 to the Aran Islands. His circumstances improved slightly when he attained a horse and sidecar, in which he carried out hauling jobs on the island, and also to drive visitors around the Island to view the scenery.In November 1931, Robert J. Flaherty, an American documentary film maker, along with his family, visited the island and contracted Mullen to drive them around Aran. They formed a connection, and when Flaherty returned back to the Island the following year, he employed Mullen as his local-contact man and also assistant director for his film, Man of Aran. He recruited cast members from the island’s population and also coached them into carrying out scenes for the film, which were at times dangerous, as they were filmed on the edges of cliffs and also in tough sea conditions. Mullen starred in the film as a basking shark hunter. He spent nine weeks in London recording sound dialogue in the Gaumont-British studios along with his fellow cast members. Following the success of the film, Mullen wrote a book with the same title Man of Aran (October 1934), which included accounts of the making of the film, along with other parts of his life. Later life and death He moved to Bull Bay, Anglesey in Wales in 1952 after making friendships with different visitors on Inishmore island, who had sent him correspondence and books. Mullen wrote two books documenting his life in the west of Ireland after the Irish premiere of Man of Aran in May 1934. One book was Hero Breed (1937) and the other was Come Another Day which was published by Faber and Faber in 1940. His autobiography in 1940 gives a more detailed insight into his life in America and his return to Aran.Mullen married his second wife, Florence Hall, in Kilronan, Inishmore on 18 August 1949. Florence Hall was a school teacher in Heather Bank, Bullbay, Anglesea, Wales. She had visited the island of Aran for 24 years after marrying her husband. The death of Mullen's siblings Mary Mullen in Los Angeles, California in 1955 and Joseph Mullen in Suffolk, Massachusetts in 1966, died only a few years after he moved to Wales. The deaths of his siblings may have brought him back to Inishmore, as he returned regularly to enjoy the summers there.Mullen's eldest child Barbara Mullen (1914-1979), starred as Janet MacPherson, the stubborn Scottish housekeeper, in the BBC television series 'Dr Finlay's Casebook' in 1964. She was interviewed by Eamonn Andrews on the programme 'This is Your Life' where Patrick Mullen appeared as a guest at 81 years old and her brother P.J. Mullen also made an appearance to look back on Barbara Mullen's life. Mullen is also seen dancing with his daughter during the show.He was the last of his ten siblings to die in Carnarvonshire, Wales on the 16 September 1972. Mullen's ashes were spread on Inishmore in Killeany Cemetery, but people have claimed that his first cremation burial was on the island in Christian times. Legacy Mullen's legacy can be seen through his role in the film Man of Aran and in his subsequent book, also entitled Man of Aran (1934), which can be described as a detailed account of the making of the film, also sketches his earlier life in the Aran Islands and the United States. Mullen wrote and published three more novels: a novel of Aran life, Hero breed (1936) part factual record, part fantastical story telling; a Folklore collection, Irish tales (1938), and the autobiographical Come another day (1940).His books detailing the beauty of Aran is said to have contributed to bringing much more tourism to the island that once saw little to no tourism at all, where there is a rent-a-bike station owned by relatives of Mullen so tourists can navigate the island by bike. The story in the movie The Man of Aran in which Mullen played the role of a shark hunter, resulted om people from different countries becoming curious of the island, what life was like there, and how much of it was accurate to the movie. Mullen's written works and contribution in the movie also brought more awareness and tourism to Gaeltacht areas, as he wrote parts in Irish as well as English, including the Aran Islands as they are an official Gaeltacht area.

Ivan Naumovich,Ukrainian writers,Writers,"Ivan Grigorievitch Naumovich (Polish: Iwan Naumowicz, Russian: Ива́н Григо́рьевич Наумо́вич, Ukrainian: Іва́н Григо́рович Нау́мович; (January 14, 1826 – August 16, 1891), was a priest, member of parliament, writer, and major figure in the Russophile movement in western Ukraine. His article Glimpse into the future was considered the most important manifesto of Galician Russophilism Background During the 19th century the area currently known as western Ukraine was part of the Austrian Empire. Its people consisted primarily of Poles and Ukrainians. The Poles had ruled over western Ukraine prior to the Austrians having ruled over it, and made up most of the nobility. They dominated the region politically and economically. The Ukrainians, although a numeric majority, were mostly peasants or priests. During the nineteenth century the people who are now known as Ukrainians referred to themselves as Rusyny, typically translated as Ruthenians. Among the Ruthenians, two competing national ideologies developed: Russophilism, the belief that there was no such thing as a Ukrainian nation and that the people of western Ukraine were the westernmost branch of the Russian people, and Ukrainophilism, the belief that there was a Ukrainian nation separate from a Russian one and that the people of western Ukraine belonged to that Ukrainian nation. Although initially the Austrian authorities supported Russophilism as a counterbalance against the Poles, when Austria and Russia became rivals Austria shifted its support to the Ukrainophile movement. Biography Ivan Naumovich was born into a clerical family in western Ukraine, which was at the time part of the Austrian Empire; his father was a school teacher but his grandfather was a priest. Like many with his social background, the family spoke the Polish language at home while maintaining Ruthenian traditions. When Naumovich entered a Ukrainian Catholic seminary in Lviv in 1848, he became swept up into and joined the Polish revolutionary movement and attempted to convince other Ukrainians to join the Polish cause. These efforts met with complete rejection from the Ukrainian peasants, causing Naumovich to turn away from the Poles. Naumovich married in 1851 and finished his studies that year, becoming a parish priest in Skalat.Initially Naumovich focused his efforts on attempting to rid the Ukrainian Greek Catholic Church of various Roman Catholic rituals and practices that it had adopted during the centuries of Catholic Polish rule, a process referred to as purification, in order to reestablish the pure ""Russian"" character of the Church. Such actions earned him great popularity among the Ukrainian people, and he was elected to the Galician Diet in 1861 and the Austrian parliament in 1873. During this time he was a passionate defender of the rights of the Ruthenian people against the Polish landlords and supported the division of the province of Galicia into western (Polish) and Eastern (Ukrainian, which Naumovich considered to be Russian) parts. Naumovich also founded the Kachkovsky Society, the Russophile counterpart and rival to the pro-Ukrainian Prosvita, which involved creating pro-Russian reading rooms for Ruthenian peasants. The intensity of Naumovich's pro-Russian activities earned the distrust of the Austrian authorities and of the Catholic Church. A seemingly minor incident in 1881 led to his downfall. In that year, the 129 inhabitants of a small village demanded their own Ukrainian Catholic parish and church rather than to pay to support the building of a new church in a neighboring village that would serve both villages. When their petition for a new church in their own village was denied, the villagers voted to convert their village to Eastern Orthodoxy. This event caught the attention of the Vatican and of the Austrian authorities in Vienna, who feared that it portended the beginning of large-scale conversion to Orthodoxy and to a Russian orientation. An investigation proved that Ivan Naumovich, despite being a Greek Catholic priest, wrote the peasants' petition requesting conversion to Orthodoxy.In 1882 Naumovich was arrested for treason. Acquitted of that charge, he was instead convicted of disturbing public order and spent eight months in prison. In 1885 he was excommunicated from the Ukrainian Greek Catholic Church. Naumovich converted to Russian Orthodoxy and settled in Kiev, then part of the Russian Empire, before becoming a parish priest in a village outside Kiev. Naumovich died in 1891 in Novorossiysk. Writings and Ideas In 1866 the Austrian Empire was defeated in the Austro-Prussian War and central authorities found themselves weakened. Representative of various nationalities took advantage of this weakness to agitate for demands for more power the central authorities. Unlike their Polish rivals in eastern Galicia, Ukrainian community leaders made no demands, instead declaring their strong loyalty to the Habsburgs and hoped that this loyalty would be rewarded. However, in order to appease the restless Poles, the Austrian authorities gave in to many of their demands. The demands included greater Polish control over lands at the expense of the Ukrainian rivals, who had declared their loyalty to Austria. A Glimpse into the Future, anonymously written by Naumovich and signed as ""One in the Name of Many"", was a response to these events. It would become the main manifesto of the Russophile movement in western Ukraine. The manifesto had two parts. The first part was an attack on the traditional Ukrainian policy of unconditional loyalty to the Habsburgs. He identified the fact that ""our kindheartedness and tact"" towards the Austrian Emperor at the time of his defeat was less effective than the agitation of the Polish enemies. He contrasted the weak behaviors of Ukrainians with that of Serbs and Romanians within the Empire and proclaimed that if Ukrainian policies were to continue all Ukrainians would eventually become Polonized. This view of the situation eventually came to be accepted by most elements of Ukrainian society, even those (such as the Ukrainophiles) that did not follow Naumovich to the conclusion he drew in the second part of his article.In the second part of A Glimpse into the Future, Naumovich concluded that the failure of Ukrainian leaders could be traced to their efforts to create a new western Ruthenian nation. He claimed that such efforts were in vain, and that from the perspective of ethnography, language, literature and ritual the people of Galicia, Kiev, Moscow, Tobolsk, etc. were all one Russian people. According to Naumovich, only by uniting with other Russians would Galician Ruthenians be able to maintain their East Slavic culture and Eastern Slavic religion and traditions. He proposed that Standard Russian should be adopted as the literary language among Ruthenians. He did not explicitly call for a detachment of eastern Galicia to Russia (perhaps in order to assuage the Austrian censors) but mentioned the case of Italian-populated regions of Switzerland which chose to remain in Switzerland rather than join Italy because they were ""happy in Switzerland."" Naumovich noted that, in contrast, Ruthenians were ""not necessarily happy.""The publication of A Glimpse into the Future caused a response not only in the Austrian but also in the German, French and Russian presses.Like other Galician Russophiles, Ivan Naumovich claimed a special place for the Ukrainian people within the Russian nation. He declared that the Russian language was derived from ""Little Russian"" and was only being readopted, and that the modern Russian language had been created in the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries by scholars from Ukraine. Notes ","['Ivan Grigorievitch Naumovich (Polish: Iwan Naumowicz, Russian: Ива́н Григо́рьевич Наумо́вич, Ukrainian: Іва́н Григо́рович Нау́мович; (January 14, 1826 – August 16, 1891), was a priest, member of parliament, writer, and major figure in the Russophile movement in western Ukraine.', 'His article Glimpse into the future was considered the most important manifesto of Galician Russophilism Background During the 19th century the area currently known as western Ukraine was part of the Austrian Empire.', 'Its people consisted primarily of Poles and Ukrainians.', 'The Poles had ruled over western Ukraine prior to the Austrians having ruled over it, and made up most of the nobility.', 'They dominated the region politically and economically.', 'The Ukrainians, although a numeric majority, were mostly peasants or priests.', 'During the nineteenth century the people who are now known as Ukrainians referred to themselves as Rusyny, typically translated as Ruthenians.', 'Among the Ruthenians, two competing national ideologies developed: Russophilism, the belief that there was no such thing as a Ukrainian nation and that the people of western Ukraine were the westernmost branch of the Russian people, and Ukrainophilism, the belief that there was a Ukrainian nation separate from a Russian one and that the people of western Ukraine belonged to that Ukrainian nation.', 'Although initially the Austrian authorities supported Russophilism as a counterbalance against the Poles, when Austria and Russia became rivals Austria shifted its support to the Ukrainophile movement.', 'Biography Ivan Naumovich was born into a clerical family in western Ukraine, which was at the time part of the Austrian Empire; his father was a school teacher but his grandfather was a priest.', 'Like many with his social background, the family spoke the Polish language at home while maintaining Ruthenian traditions.', 'When Naumovich entered a Ukrainian Catholic seminary in Lviv in 1848, he became swept up into and joined the Polish revolutionary movement and attempted to convince other Ukrainians to join the Polish cause.', 'These efforts met with complete rejection from the Ukrainian peasants, causing Naumovich to turn away from the Poles.', 'Naumovich married in 1851 and finished his studies that year, becoming a parish priest in Skalat.', 'Initially Naumovich focused his efforts on attempting to rid the Ukrainian Greek Catholic Church of various Roman Catholic rituals and practices that it had adopted during the centuries of Catholic Polish rule, a process referred to as purification, in order to reestablish the pure ""Russian"" character of the Church.', 'Such actions earned him great popularity among the Ukrainian people, and he was elected to the Galician Diet in 1861 and the Austrian parliament in 1873.', 'During this time he was a passionate defender of the rights of the Ruthenian people against the Polish landlords and supported the division of the province of Galicia into western (Polish) and Eastern (Ukrainian, which Naumovich considered to be Russian) parts.', 'Naumovich also founded the Kachkovsky Society, the Russophile counterpart and rival to the pro-Ukrainian Prosvita, which involved creating pro-Russian reading rooms for Ruthenian peasants.', ""The intensity of Naumovich's pro-Russian activities earned the distrust of the Austrian authorities and of the Catholic Church."", 'A seemingly minor incident in 1881 led to his downfall.', 'In that year, the 129 inhabitants of a small village demanded their own Ukrainian Catholic parish and church rather than to pay to support the building of a new church in a neighboring village that would serve both villages.', 'When their petition for a new church in their own village was denied, the villagers voted to convert their village to Eastern Orthodoxy.', 'This event caught the attention of the Vatican and of the Austrian authorities in Vienna, who feared that it portended the beginning of large-scale conversion to Orthodoxy and to a Russian orientation.', ""An investigation proved that Ivan Naumovich, despite being a Greek Catholic priest, wrote the peasants' petition requesting conversion to Orthodoxy."", 'In 1882 Naumovich was arrested for treason.', 'Acquitted of that charge, he was instead convicted of disturbing public order and spent eight months in prison.', 'In 1885 he was excommunicated from the Ukrainian Greek Catholic Church.', 'Naumovich converted to Russian Orthodoxy and settled in Kiev, then part of the Russian Empire, before becoming a parish priest in a village outside Kiev.', 'Naumovich died in 1891 in Novorossiysk.', 'Writings and Ideas In 1866 the Austrian Empire was defeated in the Austro-Prussian War and central authorities found themselves weakened.', 'Representative of various nationalities took advantage of this weakness to agitate for demands for more power the central authorities.', 'Unlike their Polish rivals in eastern Galicia, Ukrainian community leaders made no demands, instead declaring their strong loyalty to the Habsburgs and hoped that this loyalty would be rewarded.', 'However, in order to appease the restless Poles, the Austrian authorities gave in to many of their demands.', 'The demands included greater Polish control over lands at the expense of the Ukrainian rivals, who had declared their loyalty to Austria.', 'A Glimpse into the Future, anonymously written by Naumovich and signed as ""One in the Name of Many"", was a response to these events.', 'It would become the main manifesto of the Russophile movement in western Ukraine.', 'The manifesto had two parts.', 'The first part was an attack on the traditional Ukrainian policy of unconditional loyalty to the Habsburgs.', 'He identified the fact that ""our kindheartedness and tact"" towards the Austrian Emperor at the time of his defeat was less effective than the agitation of the Polish enemies.', 'He contrasted the weak behaviors of Ukrainians with that of Serbs and Romanians within the Empire and proclaimed that if Ukrainian policies were to continue all Ukrainians would eventually become Polonized.', 'This view of the situation eventually came to be accepted by most elements of Ukrainian society, even those (such as the Ukrainophiles) that did not follow Naumovich to the conclusion he drew in the second part of his article.', 'In the second part of A Glimpse into the Future, Naumovich concluded that the failure of Ukrainian leaders could be traced to their efforts to create a new western Ruthenian nation.', 'He claimed that such efforts were in vain, and that from the perspective of ethnography, language, literature and ritual the people of Galicia, Kiev, Moscow, Tobolsk, etc.

Jillian Becker,British writers,Writers,"Jillian Becker (born 2 June 1932) is a South African-born British author, journalist, and lecturer. She specialises in research about terrorism, having written Hitler's Children: The Story of the Baader-Meinhof Terrorist Gang (1977), among other works. Life Becker's father, Bernard Friedman, was a South African surgeon and politician who co-founded the anti-apartheid Progressive Party. Becker attended Roedean School in Johannesburg. Becker graduated from the University of the Witwatersrand. She left her first husband, Michael Geber, in South Africa to live in Italy with her second husband, Gerry Becker, later moving to Mountfort Crescent off Barnsbury Square, in London. It was here that Becker's friend, Sylvia Plath, came to stay with her young children in the days immediately before Plath committed suicide and Becker's book about Plath's last days, Giving Up is based. Becker has been a British citizen since 1960.Becker is on the council of the Freedom Association. She lives in California.She is the manager and editor of The Atheist Conservative blog Published works She has written an account of the death of her friend, the poet Sylvia Plath, who stayed with Becker for the last weekend of her life. Dissatisfied with the biographers' treatments and after seeing the film script to Sylvia (and declining the opportunity to have anything to do with the film), Becker decided to write her own account of Plath's death: Giving Up: the last days of Sylvia Plath. Her most famous book, Hitler's Children: The Story of the Baader-Meinhof Terrorist Gang, is about the German Red Army Faction. The book was chosen by Golo Mann as Newsweek (Europe) book of the year 1977 and serialised in newspapers in London, Oslo and Tokyo. The PLO: The Rise and Fall of the Palestine Liberation Organization was commissioned by Weidenfeld & Nicolson and published in 1984. Becker spent months in Lebanon during the war in which Israel drove the PLO out of that country. She claimed to have retrieved secret documents from ruins of bombed PLO office buildings and to have interviewed Lebanese of all denominations and Palestinians who had experienced PLO oppression, as well as supporters, members and leaders of the PLO. Institute for the Study of Terrorism In the 1980s, Becker served in a multi-party working group to advise the British Parliament on measures to combat international terrorism. She was also consulted by the embassies of several countries affected by indigenous terrorist organisations, some of which were supported by foreign nation states. In many of these cases, terrorist activity was an aspect of proxy wars, or what Becker called ""the hot spots of the Cold War"".In 1985, with Lord Chalfont, a former minister in the Foreign and Commonwealth Office, she founded the ""Institute for the Study of Terrorism"" (IST) of which she was executive director from 1985 to 1990. With Chalfont on the presiding council were Baroness Cox, who was then deputy speaker of the House of Lords, and Lord Orr-Ewing. The institute's International Advisory Council included experts in many Western countries on terrorism, security, weaponry, and geo-politics. In the Institute itself Becker worked with a small staff of researchers and translators. Bernhard Adamczewski was her co-director at IST. Books Selected fiction Becker, Jillian (1971). The Keep.

James Hla Kyaw,Burmese writers,Writers,"James Hla Kyaw (1866-1919), also known as U Hla Kyaw (Burmese: ဦးလှကျော်), was a pioneer Burmese novelist and author of the first Burmese novel titled Maung Yin Maung, Ma Me Ma. Burmese novels had existed before but they were written in verse not in prose. Most of these novels were based on Buddhism, myth and legend and history of Burma; therefore there were no novels that were based on everyday lives like Maung Yin Maung, Ma Me Ma. Personal life and death Born in 1866 to a Buddhist family, James Hla Kyaw converted to Christianity after his parents died when he was young, and he was sent to live with his uncle's family who were also Christian converts. James Hla Kyaw was a bright student at school, and he went on to pass many examinations including law. He married four times. His first wife was Ma Khin Htay Ngwe with whom he had two children but later separated. He had no children with his second or third wife, and he died while he was married to his fourth wife, Ma Min Thar. He reverted to Buddhism later in his life after he had studied the Buddha's teachings. He worked as a bank manager, and a mayor in towns, Sagaing, Chaung-U, Budalin. James Hla Kyaw's health deteriorated while he was working as a provincial mayor in Myinmu, a provincial town north of Mandalay. He returned to Rangoon to seek medical treatment but his health continued to deteriorate; therefore, he retired at the age of 37. He decided to write Maung Yin Maung, Ma Me Ma while living in Sint O Dan, Rangoon. He wrote several articles in the Hanthawaddy, the Friend of Burma and the Burma Critics Newspapers. His health turned for the worse after he suffered a stroke. He still could not move his left arm, even after he had recovered. Following his doctor's advice he later moved to a warmer place, Meiktila in Upper Burma, where he died at the age of 53. Life as a writer He started writing Maung Yin Maung, Ma Me Ma while he was in Rangoon. Although the novel was actually a translation of Alexandre Dumas, père's The Count of Monte Cristo, it was more an 'adaptation' than a direct translation as he created his own characters and blended into the story Burmese culture and beliefs. While, Dumas's protagonist took revenge on all those who had mistreated him in the novel, James Hla Kyaw's hero Maung Yin Maung forgave them all, as should be done according to the teachings of the Buddha. The settings were completely different just as the characters were. His novel became a best-seller as Burma's first romantic novel. It was first published in 1904 at No. 71, Phayre Street by Friend of Burma Press with 12 black and white photographs and has since been reprinted six times. Today, over 100 years later, the first novel ever published in Burma is set to hit the big screen. The Moe Kaung Kin Movie Production Company has taken on the task of turning the much-loved Burmese classic into a cinematic masterpiece. Screenplay writer Aung Soe Oo said he and the others had agreed to pay royalty for the book, even though they were not obliged to; a novel or the work of an artist becomes public domain 50 years after the death of its author in Burma. He also stated that to honour the author, they had decided to give a royalty cheque to his next-of-kin in any case. James Hla Kyaw's granddaughter Daw Khin Htar Oo, who lives in Mandalay, would receive the sum of K300,000 (about 300 USD).Besides being a writer, James Hla Kyaw enjoyed huge success as a lawyer and translator. He wrote several articles and law books after completing the novel Maung Yin Maung, Ma Me Ma, an extract from which is included in the newly revised prescribed text for matriculation students as part of Burmese literature. Unfortunately, most of his other novels were destroyed by a great fire during the Second World War and only his first novel survived to this day. He was widely known and remembered today as a great novelist. James Hla Kyaw had suffered from chronic illnesses since he was young, but he never gave up and Burma owes its first novel to him.

Kim Chae-won (writer),South Korean writers,Writers,"Kim Chae-won is a South Korean author best known for the dreamlike quality of her prose. Life Kim Chae-won was born in Deokso, Gyeonggi Province in 1946. She studied painting at Ewha Womans University. Her father is the poet Kim Dong-hwan, one of Korea's foremost modernist poets (he wrote Korea's first modern epic, Night at the Border), and her mother is the novelist Choe Jeong-hui. Kim grew up with her older sister under the care of her mother after her father was kidnapped by the North Korean government during the political turmoil after the Korean War. Her older sister Kim Ji-won is also a novelist, and both sisters have received the respected Yi Sang Literary Award. They have collaborated on the short story collections Faraway House Faraway Sea and Home, She Was Not There. Kim Chae-won's childhood growing up without a father has had a direct and indirect effect on her work. In Kim's novels her father is depicted as a victim of Korea's tragic history. The remaining family copes with his absence and decline, becoming tragic victims themselves. The pain and lack in the family that comes with the father's absence and decline becomes rooted as a trauma that controls their lives thereon. The examination of how this trauma may be internalized and sublimated is the subject of Kim's most important literary achievement, the “Hallucination” series. The wounds of Korea's modern history are thus at the bottom of Kim's work characterized by its fantastical and dreamlike aesthetic. Work Kim made her literary debut in 1975 with “Greetings at Night” (Baminsa), published in the journal, Contemporary Literature (Hyeondae munhak). Among her major works are “The Hand of the Moon” (Darui son), “Ice House” (Eoreum jip), “Honeymoon” (Mirwol), “A Green Hat” (Chorok bit moja), “Mountain Diary” (Sanjunggi), “The Breath of May” (Oworui sumgyeol), “Summer Fantasy” (Yeoreumui hwan), and “A Wordless Song” (Mueonga.Kim's writing is confessional and first-person, featuring a single subjective gaze. Her characters often feel helpless and lost, often juxtaposing present experiences with memories in an evocative rather than declarative way. Awards In 1989 she was awarded the Yi Sang Literary Award for “Winter Fantasy”.

Early life Ran Banda was born in the remote village of Maradankalla near Mihintale, in the Anuradhapura District. His father was a teacher and an ayurvedic healer known as Wannihamy. The idiomatic usage of language evident in his mature writing and speeches stand witness to the fact that he never lost touch with his village heritage. He sometimes called himself a Bayya (Hillbilly) from Mihintale and did so with a great sense of pride. Mature Years After qualifying as an attorney-at-law he practiced in Hultsdorf, Colombo. He was an active member of the Bar Association of Sri Lanka, notably representing Sepala Ekanayake, a Sri Lankan who gained international notoriety after hijacking an Alitalia Boeing 747 with 340 passengers on June 30, 1982.He embarked on a career in broadcast presentation and was popular for his wit and choice of language as a television and radio personality.

Zayd Mutee' Dammaj,Yemeni writers,Writers,"Zayd Mutee' Dammaj (Arabic:زيد مطيع دماج), (1943 - March 20, 2000) was a Yemeni author and politician. He is best known for his short novel The Hostage which was selected by the Arab Writers Union as one of the top 100 Arabic novels of the 20th century. Life and work Dammaj was born in As Sayyani District of Ibb Governorate. His father Sheikh Mutee' bin Abdullah Dammaj was a committed revolutionary activist against the rule of Imam Yahya and went on to establish a political party named Al-Ahrar in Aden in 1943. He was imprisoned that year in Al-Shabakah Prison, located in Taiz province, for his political activities. However, in April 1944 managed to escape on foot to Aden. Sheikh Mutee' continued his struggle against the Imamate regime and became the first governor of Ibb Governorate after the revolution of 1962. The young Dammaj was educated in the village madrasa and at home, before his father sent him to a school in Taiz, where he boarded with friends of his father. In 1958, Dammaj went to Egypt where he studied in schools in Bani Suwayf and Tanta, before enrolling in Cairo University in 1964. He studied law for a couple of years before deciding to switch to journalism. He had already started to write political articles and short fiction that was published in the New Yemen periodical. In 1968, still in the middle of his studies, he was summoned back home to participate in the anti-royalist movement with his father. In 1970, Dammaj was elected to the Shura Council, regarded as Yemen's first elected parliament, as a representative of his native district of As-Sayyani. His political rise continued: in 1976 he was appointed governor of the Mahweet governorate, and in 1980 he became Yemen's ambassador to Kuwait. In 1982, he cemented his place in Yemen's political hierarchy when he was elected to the Permanent Committee of the General People’s Congress, the ruling party at the time. Parallel to his political career, Dammaj also pursued a career as a literary writer. His first volume of short stories was published in 1973, while Al-Rahinah (The Hostage) was published in 1984. It went through multiple printings in Arabic and has since been translated into French, English, German and Hindi, among others. It is widely regarded as the most famous Yemeni novel and a classic of modern Arabic literature. Dammaj was 57 when he died on March 20, 2000, in Middlesex Hospital in London. His eldest son Hamdan Dammag is a Yemeni/British computer scientist and a prize-winner novelist, who has also published several books of poetry and short stories.

Kiné Kirama Fall,Senegalese writers,Writers,"Kiné Kirama Fall is the pseudonym of a Senegalese poet (born 1934) who published two volumes of her French-language verse in the 1970s, when there were not many women writers in Senegal. She is known for the mystical quality of her poems, which express a love of nature and of God. Biography She was born in 1934 in the coastal town of Rufisque near Dakar. She had no high school education and came late to literacy in French. This may have freed her from European conventions and contributed a Senegalese authenticity to her work, according to poet-politician Leopold Senghor. Fall felt honoured by the support she had from President Senghor, who wrote an introduction to her first book of poetry. After reading her poems and meeting her, the poet Birago Diop took an interest in her work and gave her encouragement. In the early 1970s Fall was working in news. In 1973 she told an interviewer that her poetry was nearly always song: singing of the earth, the sea, the sky, but above all of God. Her themes chose her, she said: themes mainly of ""nature, God and human experience"". Senghor thought her work showed a ""typically African combination of spirituality and sensuality"". Another critic mentions the ""freshness, economy, and spirituality"" she brings to writing about love, torment, faith and nature.She was one of an early generation of women writers in Senegal who emerged in the years after independence in 1960 but remained for some time almost unknown internationally. Fall said she was singing for all the girls and women of Africa. Her poems have echoes of regional traditions of orality, most obviously in praise songs, and echoes too of her native Wolof language.

Bernhard Schaub,Swiss writers,Writers,"Bernhard Schaub (born 1954) is a Swiss holocaust denier and a far-right activist. He works in Switzerland and Germany. He gained publicity, particularly in Switzerland, due to his book ""Adler und Rose"" (1992, self-published). Professional career Bernhard Schaub was born in Bern. He was a teacher at a Waldorf school (a type of school based on Rudolf Steiner’s Waldorf pedagogy) in Adliswil, but was fired in January 1993, after his above-mentioned book received publicity and therefore his ideology was unveiled. Afterwards he worked for the Klubschule in Frauenfeld until 1999 as a ""pädagogischer Mitarbeiter"" (pedagogic collaborator). He was sacked after a lecture in Munich that took place on 15 June 1998 (quote: ""Europa ist die Heimat der weißen Rasse"" – ""Europe is the home of the white race"") Since then he has been a speaker at events, both domestically and internationally, in the far-right extremist scene (e.g. Germany's NPD party). Activities March 1994: Foundation of the ""Arbeitsgemeinschaft zur Enttabuisierung der Zeitgeschichte"" (AEZ) – ""Work community to free history from taboos"". Later the group was renamed ""Arbeitsgemeinschaft zur Erforschung der Zeitgeschichte"" (work community for the exploration of history). The founders were four former teachers: Arthur Vogt, Andreas Studer, Jürgen Graf, and Schaub. The related magazine ""Aurora"", which ran to 13 editions between 1994 and 1997 (print runs up to 200 copies), was predominantly written by Schaub. Furthermore, the group tried to spread Holocaust-denying ideology in Switzerland. They sent out – according to their own statements – propaganda to 6000 political and university addresses (""Zurück ins Mittelalter?"" – ""Back to the Middle Ages?""). For the same purposes a professionally printed brochure, which denied the existence of gas chambers in Auschwitz, was also distributed (""Das Rudolf-Gutachten"" – ""The Rudolf Report"").Bernhard Schaub collaborated with the far-right ""Partei National Orientierter Schweizer"" (Party of Nationally Oriented Swiss Citizens) (PNOS), which included a violent faction among its members. He wrote the party manifesto and also contributed columns for the party’s paper ""Zeitgeist"". After his apparently voluntary exit from the party, he founded the ""Nationale Außerparlamentarische Opposition"" (National Extra-parliamentary Opposition) (NAPO) in Switzerland, which describes itself as a ""Sammelbewegung für den echten nationalen Widerstand in der Schweiz"" (""collective movement for genuine national resistance in Switzerland""). Schaub is president of the Verein zur Rehabilitierung der wegen Bestreitens des Holocaust Verfolgten (VRBHV – Organisation for the rehabilitation of people persecuted for denying Holocaust), which was founded by notable Holocaust deniers including Horst Mahler, Manfred Roeder and Ernst Zündel.

Posts he held at The Straits Times include Science and Technology editor, Sunday Review editor, Life! deputy editor, senior political correspondent and also a foreign correspondent based in Beijing and Hong Kong.

The Lady of Soul and Her Ultimate 'S' Machine (1993) Written as part of TheatreWorks' pioneering Writers' Lab, The Lady of Soul and Her Ultimate 'S' Machine enjoyed a first reading in January 1992, directed by Ivan Heng, whom Tan credits for bringing out the ""comic possibilities"" of the play. Actor Gerald Chew acted in this reading, and in 2001 directed it for TheatreWorks' theatre retrospective, Charging Up Memory Lane. After the reading, The Lady of Soul and Her Ultimate 'S' Machine was submitted to the police's Public Entertainment Licensing Unit for vetting. The script came back from the police - then the body responsible for arts licensing, a task that now falls on the Media Development Authority - with objections to material in 36 of its 67 pages, including: that Singapore is a nation without soul; that the play promotes sex and communism; that the play ridicules past committees as inefficient; that politicians were more interested in winning votes than delivering on promises. In October 1992, Tan sent in a letter of appeal to the licensing unit and the play was passed clean, a beneficiary of the revised guidelines proposed by the Censorship Review Committee. First staged by TheatreWorks from January to February 1993, directed by Ong Keng Sen and starring actors Lut Ali, Lim Kay Tong and Jacintha Abisheganaden.

Nestor Ignat,Romanian writers,Writers,"Nestor Ignat Filotti (2 March 1918 – 29 August 2016) was a Romanian journalist, writer and graphic artist. He was best known for his strong support for Marxist-Leninist ideology in culture. Journalist Born in Iași in 1918, Ignat graduated from the Spiru Haret National College of Bucharest in 1936 and continued his studies at the University of Bucharest. Nestor Ignat joined the Romanian Communist Party while it was still illegal. In 1944 he joined the staff of the Scînteia newspaper, where he was appointed editor. Working with the chief editor Sorin Toma and deputy chief editor Silviu Brucan, Nestor Ignat wrote editorial attacking the non-communist political parties and vocally demanding the sentencing to death of their leaders. This part of his activity is often quoted as an example of an expression of the Stalinist ideological excesses and intolerance.Ignat's journalistic activity focused mainly on the ideological aspects. A staunch supporter of proletcultism, he defended the ideological purity of the socialist society and exposed the ""bourgeois"" intellectuals. He also published articles in literary magazines where he exposed not only the writers which he considered as being ""reactionary"" but also communist critics who were insufficiently pugnacious. An example is his study on Lucian Blaga published in Viața Românească in which he wrote: ""Now when justice is under way for sentencing big and small criminals, it is our duty to denounce, to dispel all confusion, to tear off masks however well they might be composed, to through light into the darkness where fascism swarmed. We must eradicate evil, to extirpate it from every corner of the spirit. Those are the reasons for which we opened the ""Blaga case"", to enable all those who dreamed of an ""aeonic"" future, that the hour of reckoning has come and that nothing and nobody can escape from the crushing judgement of history."" A new wave of attacks started after student movements of 1956. A typical article of this period is a criticism of Anatol E. Baconsky, editor in chief of the magazine ""Steaua"" published by the Cluj section of the Writers' Union of Romania. This time Nestor Ignat disagrees with Baconsky's study of Mateiu Caragiale, accusing him of moving away from Marxism and from the ""Leninist methods of revaluation of cultural heritage"", of ignoring socialist realism and militant literature.Ignat was one of the most zealous supporters of socialist realism; he was part of the first team of professors at the Faculty of Philosophy of the University of Bucharest, one of the most ideologized institutions of higher education in Romania at the time. Together with Sorin Toma, Ofelia Manole, Mihail Roller, Ștefan Voicu, Traian Șelmaru, Nicolae Moraru, Paul Niculescu-Mizil, he was part of the group of zealots in the immediate entourage of Leonte Răutu, then head of the Propaganda and Culture Department. Subsequently, Ignat was in charge of the theoretical journal of the Central Committee of Communist Party, Class Struggle. By the nature of the positions he held, he was directly involved in all the important ideological decisions of those times.He held important functions in various professional organizations. He was chairman of the Union of Journalists and member of the National Council on the Romanian State Radio and Television Networks. He was also dean of the Faculty of Journalism of the University of Bucharest, giving up his position after the Romanian Revolution of 1989. Though he remained close to the higher hierarchy of the Romanian Communist Party, he became less active after Gheorghe Gheorghiu-Dej's death in 1965. In 1974, at the 11th Congress of the Communist Party, he was not elected a member of the Central Committee, although he had been proposed by his County Organization. There were only two political figures whose candidacy was rejected by the Congress. Poet and writer Ignat started writing poems while he was still in university, one of his first being ""Magic"" (Magie) published in 1939 in the ""Jurnalul literar"":Ignat started writing poems while he was still in university, one of his first being ""Magic"" (Magie) published in 1939 in the ""Jurnalul literar"": After his involvement in politics, Nestor Ignat published works attempting to present a Marxist-Leninist interpretation of Romanian writers. A first such volume analyzed the journalistic activity of Mihai Eminescu, emphasizing the poet's political views. His major volume ""On the revaluation of the cultural heritage"" is more comprehensive and covers the Marxist presentation of many Romanian contemporary writers. ""The Byzantinist mystic, the wild chauvinism, the glorification of the fascist ""superman"" and the exhortation of blind submission to the will of fascist leaders, the myth of blood and the worship of death, the idealization of patriarchal retardment and of the return to the Middle Ages – spread by traitors such as Nichifor Crainic, Radu Gyr, Aron Cotruș, Mircea Eliade and other representatives of hooliganism in literature – had precise and outspoken class related goals; their school raised the gangs of murderers of the Iron Guard."" Ignat continued his attacks previous against Lucian Blaga published in literary magazines: For instance, Lucian Blaga's writings are a meeting point of all western decadent philosophical and literary trends. What could anybody find as being ""good"" or ""positive"" in Blaga's plays – an association of dark mysticism and Freudian pathological dramas – or in his misty poetry, full of morbid sensations, expressing the aspiration of immersion into nothingness, a poetry in which man is degraded to inferior levels, being transformed into a plant or a mineral? Blaga's entire work is an expression of putrid bourgeois ideology and foredoomed to perish at the same time with the class it has served. While Ignat indicates the critical way in which Communist Party considered national cultural heritage, his book acidly characterizes various Romanian writers, without presenting an analysis or a justification of those views. However, after Joseph Stalin's death, Ignat did not publish any other books on similar topics. His later works dealt with a presentation of Mexican Muralism or with impressions from his various travels and were devoid of political activism. He had shown concern for painting even before, having supported the activity of painters. Thus, he had written the presentation of painter George Ștefănescu for the latter's solo exhibition at the ""Gheorghe Tattarescu Museum"" in 1965. After the Romanian Revolution of 1989, Ignat published o booklet with his poems, which a completely different worldview. As the poems were written at the same time when Ignat was an active supporter of Communist extremism, their publication does not reflect a change of mind after the collapse of the Communist regime. In 1999 he published a Romanian translation of the originally in French written doctoral thesis of Alice Voinescu on neo-Kantianism and the Marburg school (Paris 1912). The same year, Ignat published some memoirs on Nae Ionescu, who had been one of his professors. The topic is unexpected for a journalist and indicates the variety of Nestor Ignat's areas of interest. Graphic artist Nestor Ignat also had talent as graphic artist. The booklet with his poems, published in 1996, also included reproductions of some of Ignat's drawings. Other drawings were also selected as illustrations for a bibliophile reprint of Geo Bogza's ""Offensive Poem""In 2004, at age 86, Ignat had his first exhibition as a graphic artist at the ""I.C. Petrescu"" library in Bucharest. His 64 drawings are essentially expressionistic, but also reflect influences of other modern art movements such as constructivism, futurism, cubism or surrealism. His drawings entitled ""Totalitarism"", ""Limbs"", ""War and Peace"", ""Sic transit gloria mundi"", ""End of a Century"", ""Jungle"", ""War"", ""At the Gates of Hell"", ""Big Bang"", ""Walpurgis Night"", etc., present the terrifying contemporary hysteria and dementia, the desacralization of human existence, the bestialization of human beings. The drawings seen to reflect the artist's profound anxiety, the impossibility of finding an interior peace. Part of his drawings were presented at the ""Sicardi Gallery"" in Houston. Legacy Contemporary historians investigating the history of Communism, mention Ignat as a journalist who was notorious in his rigid presentation of extreme Marxist-Leninist interpretation of the national culture, in purging the names of important Romanian writers for even minor non-conformist opinions, and for severely criticizing any other writer who dared be less intransigent. The influence of such views persisted long after the Stalin's death. Ignat's name is nearly always mentioned along with other political activists with whom he collaborated, such as Silviu Brucan. While it would be difficult to deny this ideological activity, which is clearly illustrated by his writings, Ignat's personality is significantly more complex. Even after the relative thaw after the fall of Stalinism or after the collapse of the communist regimes in Eastern Europe, Ignat was unapologetic, never denying the opinions expressed in his writings, and never attempting to justify or to explain them. Except for the period from 1945 to 1955, Ignat's publications show a completely different ideological picture. The poems published before 1944, such as ""Magic"" are impregnated with a mysticism similar with the one found in Blaga's works, which he later exposed as a sign of bourgeois decadence. His publications of the 1972–1980 period seem to avoid ideological involvement. His study of neo-Kantianism presents an idealistic philosophy opposed to materialism. His drawings are influenced by the artistic avant-garde of the years between the two world wars and does not have the slightest connection with the socialist realism which he himself had supported as the only viable artistic expression. These different approaches are however not the result of an evolution of Ignat's thinking. They seem to have coexisted. As opposed to other communist ideologists of the post-war era, to whom he is compared, Ignat did not try to rise in the political hierarchy of the Communist Party. While he did have important positions in the professional union of journalists and in the Faculty of Journalism, which both required an allegiance to the party, Ignat tried to limit his involvement strictly to journalism and avoided the party bureaucracy. The reasons why his candidacy for a membership in the party's central committee was rejected has never been investigated or explained by analysts. Ignat remains a controversial figure, still raising many unanswered questions. He died in August 2016 at the age of 98.

Tahar Ouettar,Algerian writers,Writers,"Tahar Ouettar (Arabic: الطاهر وطار; 1936 – August 12, 2010) was an Algerian writer.

Ido Reizan,Japanese writers,Writers,"Ido Reizan (井土 霊山, (1859–1935)) was a Japanese journalist, writer, poet, and liberal activist. He was involved in the Freedom and People's Rights Movement, which appears to have forced him into a nomadic lifestyle. Biography Reizan was born Wada Tsuneshige into a family of samurai in Sōma Nakamura han and later married into the Idos, who were an Azabu-stationed samurai family. His wife was Ido Sumi. His father Wada Yoshishige (和田 祥重) was a samurai-turned-farmer who wrote a handbook of farming (農業要録) (published in Tokyo in 1889). Ido attended and graduated from the Sendai Teaching College, which in the Meiji period became the Faculty of Education of Tohoku University. In a professional capacity, he worked as a journalist and an editor-in-chief at various newspapers including Osaka Mainichi Shimbun, Sanyo Shimbun, and Tokyo Yokohama Shimbun. Reizan was a prolific writer who wrote and edited 27 books, the subjects of which ranged from criminal law to Chinese poetry. He had personal acquaintance with Gotō Shinpei with whom he toured Kyushu sometime between 1909 and 1916 (most likely in October 1910 when Goto visited Kyushu). Ido advocated the establishment of the University of Manchuria, which he thought would be instrumental in introducing modernity to Manchuria and China. His proposition to provide people in Manchuria and China with higher education predates the establishment of the National Foundation University by 33 years.

Phyllis Gardner,British writers,Writers,"Phyllis Gardner (6 October 1890 – 16 February 1939) was a writer, artist, and noted breeder of Irish Wolfhounds. She and Rupert Brooke had, on her side at least, a passionate relationship. She attended the Slade School of Fine Art and was a suffragette when they met. Their conflicting politics, and his conflicted feelings, led the relationship to end. Biography Gardner spent some of her early childhood in Athens, where her father, Ernest Arthur Gardner, was Director of the British School of Archaeology. Her aunt Alice Gardner was a historian (of Newnham College) and her uncle, Percy Gardner, was also an archaeologist.Phyllis Gardner's immediate family - her mother Mary, sister Delphis and brother Christopher - moved according to Professor Gardner's career. On their return to England, they settled in Tadworth, Surrey in a large house called Farm Corner, close to the Surrey Hills. Gardner attended the progressive Saint Felix School in Southwold, Suffolk between 1907-1908. In 1908, Gardner enrolled at the Slade School of Fine Art and specialised in the craft of wood carving, but also had a fondness for drawing and painting animals. She exhibited a screen and wood carvings at the Arts and Crafts Society Eleventh Exhibition in 1916. In later years Phyllis and Delphis carved intricate chess sets, one of which forms part of the Metropolitan Museum collection.Gardner spotted Rupert Brooke in a tea-room in King's Cross station in 1911 and she, her mother and Brooke shared a train compartment to Cambridge. During the journey, Gardner felt compelled to sketch a likeness of Brooke and upon arrival in Cambridge, Gardner was determined to discover who this young blond-haired man was, and how she could meet him.After Brooke's death in 1915, Gardner devoted her time to a local hospital which treated soldiers from the front. Gardner found it difficult to cope with the loss of Brooke and found the hospital a welcome distraction. When Brooke's fellow war poet Stanley Casson wrote Brooke and Skyros in 1921, a ""quiet essay"" on the passing of his friend, Gardner contributed woodcuts to illustrate the book.Gardner's memoir about her relationship with Brooke along with their letters to one another were deposited by Delphis in the British Library in 1948 and closed to access for 50 years. Due to this lengthy closure, and the secretive way Brooke referred to Gardner in his letters, the importance of their relationship was not acknowledged in 20th century biographies of Brooke, in which Gardner hardly gets a mention at all. According to a 2015 biography, Brooke's letters to Gardner depict a cruel side which his literary executor Edward Marsh tried to hide. Indeed, Brooke's circle felt that Marsh's depiction of an exemplary young man cut down in his prime was a misleading portrayal of a more complex figure.In later life her family successfully bred Irish Wolfhounds and opened a kennel called Coolafin in Maidenhead. Gardner wrote a well-regarded history of the breed, which she illustrated. She died in February 1939 aged 48.

Abdul Ghani Hamid,Singaporean writers,Writers,"Abdul Ghani Abdul Hamid (13 April 1933–13 April 2014), commonly known as Abdul Ghani Hamid or A. Ghani Hamid; also known by his pen name Lazuardi, was a Singaporean writer, poet, and artist. Writing primarily in Malay, Abdul Ghani produced a large body of poems, plays, short stories, and newspaper articles, further participating in more than 60 art exhibitions since 1950 with his abstract paintings. He received the Anugerah Tun Seri Lanang in 1997, the Cultural Medallion for literature in 1999, and the Southeast Asia Write Award in 1998. Education and personal life Abdul Ghani was born on 13 April 1933, in Kampung Siglap (now Kampung Bahru), East Coast Road, Singapore. Abdul Ghani was educated in both English and Malay, first at Telok Kurau English School, and later completing his secondary education at Raffles Institution. While studying at Raffles Institution, he sent poems and articles he had written to local Malay newspapers and magazines and held his inaugural art exhibition during a Youth Festival. Career After his studies, Abdul Ghani worked as an apprentice at the Electrical Department of Keppel Harbour, after which, he found a job as a clerk at the Public Utilities Board, then known as the Singapore Municipality. He would only leave the job in 1988. Though he had full-time work and was a father of four, he made time to write and paint. Beyond painting and writing, Abdul Ghani also pursued photography.Abdul Ghani's writings have been published in Malaysian literary journals, Dewan Sastera and Dewan Bahasa. He further wrote for an arts column in the Singapore Malay language Sunday newspaper Berita Minggu in the ’70s, contributing comic strips such as Mat Dalang to the newspaper and other Malay magazines under the pen name Lazuardi. In 1956, the Angkatan Pelukis Muda (Young Artists' Movement) was founded and headed by Abdul Ghani, though it would be quickly dissolved after it was unable to gather enough support. In 1960, Abdul Ghani published Sekilas Pandang Senilukis Dan Perkembangannya (A Glimpse of the Arts and its Development), which has come to be seen as a significant guide for the history of Singapore Malay arts.In 1962, he co-founded the Angkatan Pelukis Aneka Daya (APAD, Artists of Various Resources) alongside Muhammad Ali Sabran, S. Mohdir, Ahmin Haji Noh, Hamidah M. F. Suhaimi and Mustafa Yassin. The association organises solo and group exhibitions, taking part in collaborations with other cultural groups, art societies, and institutions, both locally and regionally. APAD continues to exhibit works by Malay artists today.In 1990, he wrote the publication Seni Indah Masjid Di Singapura (Art of Mosques in Singapore). He was awarded the Anugerah Tun Sri Lanang by the Majlis Bahasa Melayu Singapura (Singapore Malay Language Council) in 1998, also receiving the S.E.A. Write Award the same year. For his contributions to literature in Singapore, Abdul Ghani was honoured with the Cultural Medallion for literature in 1999.Abdul Ghani suffered from a stroke in 2008, with his health declining after. On his birthday six years later on 13 Apr 2014, he passed away at the age of 81 from pneumonia, leaving behind a legacy of writings, poems, paintings, and plays. Works Art Abdul Ghani's poetry has been said to be “deeply metaphysical,” and he has further described having “transfer[red] the same feeling from [his] poetry to [his] paintings”, with his art and writing often sharing similar subjects and titles. Abdul Ghani was one of the early Singapore-based artists to employ abstraction in paintings. His 1957 painting Mata Dan Hati attracted criticism, with detractors believing that modernist influences in painting were not beneficial to local art. Responding to critiques, Abdul Ghani identified abstraction as a technique that was not solely from the West, highlighting the presence of abstraction in the tradition of calligraphy. Abdul Ghani continued to explore abstractions that made “allusions to the empirical”, for instance, in his 1973 painting Billet-Doux (Surat Cinta).Another example is his 1975 abstract painting, The Face in Meditation, which depicts a face that appears to be masked, with contorted limbs stretching across the canvas, visually reminiscent of batik with its strong outlines and bold colours. Within the context of modern art in Singapore, his work has been discussed in relation to the rise of Abstraction from the 50s and 60s onwards, with Singaporean artists engaging with Internationalism, that is, the proliferation of international artistic movements such as Abstract expressionism, which advanced ideas of universal aesthetics.His works are in the collections of the National Gallery Singapore and the Galeri Shah Alam in Selangor, Malaysia.

Mária Szepes,Hungarian writers,Writers,"Mária Szepes (Hungarian pronunciation: [ˈmaːriɒ ˈsɛpɛʃ]; 14 December 1908 – 3 September 2007) was a Hungarian author. She worked as a journalist and screenwriter, as well as an independent author in the field of hermetic philosophy since 1941. She would sometimes write under the pseudonyms Mária Papir or Mária Orsi. Life Szepes was born Magdolna Scherbach into a Hungarian family of theater stars in Budapest. Her father, Sándor Papir, was a bon vivant and great star of Budapest's stages. Her mother was primadonna. Her parents and her brother were to her like ""brothers and sisters in spirit"", as well as she admitted only spiritual relationship: ""Everything else is just experience, engagement, disengagement – karma.""From 1916 to 1933, she appeared as a film actress (mostly under the name Magda Papir). One year after marrying Béla Szepes on 2 January 1931, she accompanied him to Berlin, where they lived until Hungary's German occupation towards war's end. In her book Magie der Liebe (""Magic of Love""), Szepes writes about the marriage, which lasted 56 years, and discusses the so-called ""Alchemistic Marriage"", the dissolution of the ego in the other. Szepes studied literature, art history, and biology in Berlin. Back in Hungary she first worked as a journalist, screenplay writer, and author. Her first novel The Red Lion was written in a hideout during World War II and became a worldwide bestseller of esoteric literature. The two Raguel volumes are referred to as her chief work by Szepes herself. The Red Lion The Red Lion, Mária Szepes' first novel, was published in 1946 in Hungary (original title: A Vörös Oroszlán). During the communist regime Rákosi The Red Lion was considered to be nonconformist and therefore was prohibited. All copies of the book were ordered to be destroyed. However, the librarian and novelist Béla Hamvas managed to save four copies. Then, several supporters of the author typed up the novel, made templates for printing, and released the self-made copies through the underground. Almost 40 years later, the novel arrived at the desk of the Heyne publishing company via the agency Utoprop. The book was translated into German by Gottfried Feidel and was published as a paperback in 1984. More details regarding the history of origin are reported by Hans Joachim Alpers in his preface of the 2002 re-issue. The Red Lion has been adapted to stage and is performed in various theaters of the United States. Plot summary Szepes tells the story of the unhappy Hans Burgner, a miller's son born in the 16th century. After the death of his weak father and of a likewise miserable but beloved teacher, he becomes afraid of the unavoidable death of all living things. Driven by a monomania fed by persistent rumors of an Elixir of Immortality, he becomes an apprentice of a mysterious physician and alchemist. However, instead of listening to the Alchemist's compassionate counsel and warnings, Burgner is driven by feverish greed to murder him; in this way, he acquires the Elixir while he is still spiritually unprepared, and is cursed thereby. This is the starting-point of a journey through the centuries: while Burgner can physically die, the Elixir enables him to retain the full memory of his previous lives as he repeatedly reincarnates into a variety of different circumstances. It also bestows upon him a profound spiritual sensitivity. Several times he attempts the Great Transmutation in order to deliver himself from his self-imposed curse. Hans Burgner is refined through his various incarnations. Against the backdrop of the last five centuries of European history, he undergoes dramatic personal development: beginning as a spiritually unawakened (and even infamous) character, he matures spiritually through the various challenges he is led to confront. He is first an initiate and Aspirant, eventually attaining the perfection of human personality which characterizes the Magus, or spiritual Adept.

Oh Sangwon,Korean writers,Writers,"Oh Sangwon (Hangul: 오상원) was a South Korean writer and journalist. Life Oh Sangwon was born on November 5, 1930 in Seoncheon, Pyeonganbuk-do, Korea. Oh graduated from Seoul National University with a B.A. in French and worked as an editorial writer for the Dong-a Ilbo. Oh died in 1985.In 1953, his play “Corroding Fragments” (Nokseuneun papyeon) won the Association for New Theater (Singeuk hyeobuihoe) contest. Oh debuted as a writer in 1955 when his short story “A Respite” (Yuye) was published in the Hankook Ilbo. Work The Literature Translation Institute of Korea summarizes Oh's contributions to Korean literature: French behaviorism and existentialism, which he encountered in college, strongly influenced Oh Sangwon’s literary imagination. His works bear witness to the political chaos following the liberation and the tragedy of Korean War through characters that take bold actions to critique external reality. “A Betrayal” (Moban), a story that won him 1958 Dongin Literary Prize features a terrorist who must choose between his conscience and his duty to his political organization. “A Respite” presents a psychological study of a soldier taken captive while trying to save another man’s life and is awaiting execution. The soldier can be taken as a prototype of a superhuman, behavioristic man who makes humanistic choice even as he confronts his own mortality. “Period” (Pirieodeu), “Reality” (Hyeonsil), and “Contempt” (Momyeol) further explore the subject of Korean War. In the 1970s, he shifted his attention away from creative writing to focus on a career in journalism, working as a reporter and editorialist for the Dong-a Ilbo. During this time, he published fabular satires of contemporary events. Political and social fables such as ""The Old Fox” (Neulgeun yeou), “The King's Molar” (Imgeumnimui eogeumni), and “The Rabbit's Eyes” (Tokkiui nun) are collected in Oh Sangwon’s Fables (Oh Sangwon uhwa). In the 1980s he published semi-autobiographical short stories such as “Mountains” (San) and “The Overlapping Past” (Gyeopchin gwageo). He died on December 3, 1985.

Finally in a “normal” household, Shaul and Libby begin to build their father- daughter relationship, but their false identities cannot last forever, especially as Libby unleashes teenage fury at the lies permeating her life; those she must tell now, and those she's been fed since childhood. Milk Tala (33), an offbeat musician who just gave birth to her first daughter, takes up a job at Milky Way, a dairy for mother's milk, where women sit in working-stations for their breasts to be pumped. The milk is distributed mainly to mothers who can't or don't want to breastfeed their babies but can afford fresh organic mother's milk – For nature knows best what's best for you. The need to earn a living and support her baby with no father in the picture has pushed Tala into this awkward job. Tala soon learns the house rules: 100% discretion, 1-year minimum commitment, 40-minute pumping sessions with 3-hour intervals, strict diet, no drinking, no drugs. The only consolation is the sisterhood woven between the women at the dairy – and of course the handsome paycheck. Everything would have worked out just fine if only Tala wasn't Tala- Even though she tries her best to accept her new role, her rebellious nature keeps pushing her to confrontations. A sneaky cigarette is detected in her blood tests and Tala is suspended from the factory. Upon hitching a ride home with the 'breast'-milkman, she accidentally meets the upper-class woman who receives her own milk, an encounter which leads her to a bumpy and surprising journey, in which she learns what it really means to be a mother. On the Spectrum A bittersweet comedy about three roommates, living together under one roof. All in their late-twenties, each diagnosed with a disorder on the autistic spectrum. Through their unique, surprising, and extremely un-PC perspective about relationships, family, work, friendship, sex and social conventions, we'll get to look at ourselves in a new, strange and funny way.

Konstantinos Raktivan,Greek writers,Writers,"Konstantinos Raktivan (Greek: Κωνσταντίνος Ρακτιβάν; 1865 – 21 May 1935) was a Greek jurist and politician, who served as cabinet minister, as the de facto first Governor-General of Macedonia, president of the Athens Bar Association and of the Council of State, Speaker of the Hellenic Parliament and member and president of the Academy of Athens. Early life Konstantinos Raktivan was born in 1865 at Manchester, where his father Demetrios Raktivan (naturalized in Britain as Ractivand), a merchant from Veroia, was active in business. His mother, Maria Ismiridou, hailed from Constantinople.The young Raktivan studied law at the University of Athens, and began his practice as a lawyer in 1885, the same year as he published his first legal study. After a brief service as judge in Syros in 1888–89, he resigned from the Judicial Corps to focus on his career as a lawyer. He exercised this profession for 25 years (1885–1912), and was distinguished for his ability and integrity. Raktivan also became a driving force behind the foundation of the Athens Bar Association in 1909, of which he was elected as the first Vice President, and subsequently President for three consecutive years in 1910–12. Political career The Goudi coup of 1909 and the subsequent entry of Eleftherios Venizelos in Greek public life marked a decisive turning-point in Raktivan's life, as he soon became one of the Cretan politician's closest collaborators. Elected to the Hellenic Parliament representing Attica in the November 1910 elections, he played a leading role in the drafting of the new Greek Constitution of 1911. Raktivan was re-elected in the March 1912 and May 1915 elections. In 1912 he became Minister of Justice under Venizelos as Prime Minister, a development which also marked the definitive end of his career as a lawyer. He remained Justice Minister until the cabinet's resignation on 25 February 1915.Following the outbreak of the First Balkan War in October 1912 and the successes of the Greek Army, Raktivan was sent by Venizelos to Thessaloniki to oversee the administration of the newly conquered areas of Macedonia. The political situation there was extremely delicate. Thessaloniki in particular was a multi-national and cosmopolitan city where Greeks were a minority, and whose future was uncertain, as the interests of Greece's Balkan League allies—chiefly Bulgaria, which had troops stationed in and north of the city and claimed a condominium with Greece—as well as those of the Great Powers, clashed with Greece's. Raktivan's main task was to ensure good governance, as well as to exercise Greek sovereignty over the territory in question so as to strengthen Greece's claims in any future negotiations. In this, he was forced to work mostly through the pre-existing Ottoman administration, including the Ottoman Gendarmerie, which had been left in place. He remained at this post until June 1913, when, with the Second Balkan War against Bulgaria under way, he was replaced by Stephanos Dragoumis.In 1918, Raktivan was named Interior Minister in the Venizelos government, a post he kept until the Venizelist electoral defeat in November 1920. From this position, he oversaw the incorporation of eastern Macedonia (autumn 1918) and Western Thrace (1920) into Greece. Raktivan remained on the sidelines during the People's Party administration in 1920–22, but was elected to Parliament (the IV National Assembly) in December 1923, serving as its speaker in 1924–25. In 1926 he was appointed to the newly founded Academy of Athens by the dictatorial government of Theodoros Pangalos, but refused to recognize this act until it was repeated by a legitimate government in 1929. In 1933, he was elected president of the Academy.In 1928, the new Venizelos cabinet appointed him as president of the newly founded Council of State, which began working the next year. Raktivan himself had ardently championed the Council's foundation as the country's supreme court in 1910–11, and had even composed its first charter, but the wars and internal turmoil of the following decade had delayed its creation until 1928. Raktivan remained as head of the Council of State until his retirement in 1935, shortly before his death. From this position he laboured to, in his own words, ""establish our country as a state of justice, especially in regards to Public Administration"", but his effort was ill-timed: the Second Hellenic Republic of the Interwar period was extremely unstable, and became progressively more and more undemocratic, culminating in the restoration of the monarchy and the dictatorial Fourth of August Regime of Ioannis Metaxas in 1936.

Vasilije Damjanović,Serbian writers,Writers,"Vasilije Damjanović (Sombor, Habsburg Empire, April 1734 - Sombor, 1792) was a Serbian writer, merchant, senator and municipal judge. Biography In the period from 1747 to 1753 Damjanović attended the famed Protestant Lyceum in Pozun (Bratislava) where he came under the influence of astronomer Christian Adolf Pescheck (1676–1744), who wrote a large number of textbooks and was the first writer to consider seriously the methods of teaching mathematics, the instruction of analytical geometry, calculus, physics and astronomy. It is known that Damjanović traveled a lot throughout Europe and that he studied in Venice. He was well-educated and fluent in several languages. Damjanović was a senator in the Hungarian diet and a municipal judge in Sombor (then part of the Habsburg Empire). Serbian polymath Zaharije Orfelin (1726–1785) spoke highly of him, writing that Damjanović's knowledge of arithmetic as well as Latin, German, French, Italian, Greek, Romanian and Hungarian languages were outstanding. The Serbian merchant, Hungarian senator and municipal judge Vasilije Damjanović had more secular interests; though he wrote in Serbian vernacular, what he wrote was the first Serbian undergraduate textbook on mathematics with the following long-winded title so common of the era: ""Nova serbskaja aritmetika ili prostoe nastavlenie k Hesapu iz raznych knig sobrano, novymi primery kratcojsim obrazom izjasneno, k upotrbleniju serbskija ucascijesja junosti izdano ot Vasilija Damjanovića, V Mletkach (in Venice), 1767."" The nature of the language of the ""Aritmetika"" has been previously commented on but only very briefly. Acclaimed Slavist Nikita Ilyich Tolstoi (1923-1996) has stated that it has a Russian basis that is interspersed with Serbianisms and Slavonicisms but adds, ""not only advocated the vernacular in literature but also to a large extent succeeded in using it as the literary language in all the works"". Even such Serbian literary men of the Enlightenment as Zaharije Orfelin, called for the incorporation of the spoken language into Serbian literature, and Dositej Obradović, encouraging it during through his own teachings and literary work. Jovan Rajić too had in 1764 published two translations from Russian – ""Slovo o gresnom celoveku"" and ""Propoved ili slovo o osuzdeniji"" – both largely in the vernacular although on the title page the language described was slavenoserbski', Slavonic-Serbian. Despite this early appearance of the vernacular in Serbian literature it was not until the 1770s and 1780s with the reform of the Habsburg school system and the accession of the enlightened Joseph II, Holy Roman Emperor and his subsequent church reform, that writers such as Dositej Obradović, Emanuilo Janković, Jovan Rajić, Pavle Julinac and others were able to fully exercise and realize their vision without undue censorship. Damjanović, Orfelin, Rajić, Dositej (Obradović), Julinac, and Janković are considered to have had a seminal influence on the use of the vernacular in published literature. As far as we know, seven copies of Damjanović's ""Aritmetika"" have been preserved. Three of them are stored in the Matica Srpska Library in Novi Sad, one in the National Library in Skopje, one in the National Library in Belgrade, one in the library of the Serbian Academy of Arts and Sciences in Belgrade and one in the Museum of Literature in Osijek. ""Aritmetika"" has 368 pages of text written in the Church Cyrillic script and consists of two parts divided into six and seven chapters respectively. Damjanović's ""Aritmetika"" was used by Teodor Janković-Mirijevski (1741–1814) who reformed school systems among the Serbian and Romanian Eastern Orthodox faithful in the Austrian Empire, and later at the request of Catherine the Great went on to make the same reforms in Imperial Russia. Meanwhile, Teodor Janković-Mirijevski, Aleksije Vezilić, Avram Mrazović, and Stefan Vujanovski adopted Damjanović's ""Aritmetika"" in their respective school districts as well. The calculus books by Avram Mrazović (1794), Atanasije Dimitrijević Sekereš (an adaptation of John Felbinger's German textbook, 1777) and Jovan Došenović (1809) played a similar, enlightening role.

James Pope (educationalist),New Zealand writers,Writers,"James Henry Pope (11 September 1837 – 3 August 1913) was a New Zealand teacher, school inspector, educationalist, amateur astronomer and writer. He was the first Inspector of Native schools in New Zealand in 1880. Pope was one of the founders of the Polynesian Society and was its president from 1899 to 1900. He was the father of the poet, cricketer and teacher Robert J. Pope Early life James Henry Pope was born in St Helier, Channel Islands, on 11 September 1837, the son of Jane Dacombe and her husband James Pope, a retired English confectioner who migrated from Hampshire to Jersey in the early 1830s. He was educated privately in Jersey where he became fluent in French before he emigrated to Melbourne, Australia, with his parents in 1852 aged 15, on the ""Castle Eden"" and landed at Port Phillip, Melbourne. Pope spent the next five or so years in the Victorian gold diggings, pursuing his studies at the same time. His scholastic efforts were rewarded with the highest attainable honours of the Victorian Denominational School Board. On 22 December 1862, at Ballarat he married Helen Grant Rattray, daughter of the Sexton of the Ballarat Cemetery, in a Presbyterian service: they were to have 12 children; eight boys and four girls; two of the girls dying at an early age. Career Teacher In 1858 he was appointed headmaster of a large primary school in Ballarat, a position he held until 1863. In 1864 Pope moved to Dunedin, New Zealand to become assistant master at the High School of Otago (later Otago Boys' High School). He was soon respected for his breadth of knowledge, energy and teaching ability. He was large, untidy, apparently vague in manner, and considered to be unconventional in his methods, but he knew everything that went on in the classroom and kept strict order. He was an accomplished linguist, equally at home, it was said, in Greek, Latin, French and German, and well versed in Hebrew. He was an enthusiastic astronomer and botanist and an accomplished musician. Although unassuming, he had the confidence of his colleagues, and was acting Rector of the school from 1868 to 1869. He transferred to the Otago Girls' High School in 1873, where the principal, Margaret Burn, regarded him as her right-hand man. In 1876 Pope went back to Ballarat to become rector of Ballarat College, but his health broke down after a few months and he resigned and returned to Dunedin to recuperate. There was a staffing disruption at the Girls' High School in 1878 and as one of the steps to restore confidence in the school, Pope was appointed deputy principal. He continued to be dogged by ill health, and retired at the end of the year, highly esteemed by staff and students alike. First Inspector of Native Schools After a three-month period as an organising teacher in Taranaki in 1879; in January 1880, Pope was appointed to be an organising inspector of the 57 Native schools. This was the first opportunity of the Education Department to exert a direct influence on this branch of the national education system. His role was to supervise the teachers, inspect their work and examine pupils. His title was changed to Inspector of Native Schools in 1885. Pope's first task was to draft the native school code which would provide policy guidelines. For that period, the Māori schools were well provided with textbooks, teaching equipment and reference books. School gardens, properly fenced, were developed as model gardens for each village. New species of trees and plants were regularly sent to schools for planting in the school glebe. James Pope became a fluent speaker of Māori and one of the best informed Pākehā of his time on Māori lore and traditions. He won the respect of tribal leaders throughout the country and conferred continually with them to establish schools, keep them in good running order, and ensure that the children of school age attended school regularly. He was known in the villages as ""Te Popi"". Writer While in Dunedin he was a regular writer of leaders, articles and astronomy notes for the Evening Star. He is remembered for the reading primers he wrote for the native school pupils and for his reader on Māori health and sanitation, ""Health for the Māori: A Manual for Use in Native Schools"", to be used later as a basis for the marae campaigns of Āpirana Ngata, Reweti Kohere and Tahupōtiki Wiremu Rātana. Legacy After Pope's retirement as Chief Inspector of Native Schools in December 1903 he was presented with an Illuminated Address and a beautifully carved bookcase by the Teachers of the Native Schools Teacher's Association. Both are now on display in the Old Government Buildings, Wellington, now the home for the Law School of Victoria University, Wellington. The farewell statement concludes, ""...we, the teachers in these schools are compelled reluctantly to bid you farewell.It is no exaggeration to say that your benevolence, your matured wisdom, and your absolute justice have built up between us a relationship quite unique in its paternal character as well as in its warmth and extent"". A silver epergne presented by the Officers of the Education Department is now in the care of Rev Moorie Robinson. The history of the telescope owned by Pope is described by Dodson, Tony (1996). ""The With-Browning Telescope at Pauatahunui"". Southern Stars. 37 (2): 45. Bibcode:1996SouSt..37...45D. He stated that Ida Fownes inherited the instrument when the Fownes bought 34 Kelburn Parade from the widow of Frederick Sidney Pope who had in turn inherited the property and telescope from his father James Henry Pope in 1913. William Renwick in his biography wrote, ""All references to James Henry Pope mention his modesty, the breadth of his sympathies, the range of his interests and his considerable talents. He was, Rēweti Kōhere wrote, 'of a lovable nature and so perfectly transparent that he won your respect and confidence on your first meeting.' He was also one among a handful of men who shaped the direction of public education in this country and left a valued personal stamp on its ethos"".

Aimé Olivier de Sanderval,French writers,Writers,"Aimé Olivier de Sanderval (10 July 1840, Lyon, France – 22 March 1919), comte de Sanderval, was a French adventurer, explorer of West Africa, entrepreneur and author. Early life He was born in Lyon, the second of three brothers; Marius was born in 1839 and René in 1843.He attended the lycée Saint-Louis in Paris. He received a bachelor of science degree in 1860. In 1864, he graduated from the Parisian Central School of Arts and Manufactures (of which his uncle Théodore Olivier was a co-founder). Velocipedes In August 1865, René and Aimé Olivier, along with Georges de La Bouglise, traveled by velocipede (an early form of the bicycle) across France from Paris to Tullins to visit the Olivers' uncle, Michel Perret; they then continued on to Avignon. While still students at the Central School, the Olivier brothers became acquainted with Pierre Michaux. They became early velocipede manufacturers; In partnership with Michaux, they formed the Michaux et Cie company in May 1868. However, they eventually parted ways with Michaux, and Michaux et Cie was dissolved. The Compagnie Parisienne des Vélocipèdes was established, but the French public lost interest in the velocipede, and the second company came to an end in 1874, leaving Aimé Olivier open to another venture. In Africa A longtime admirer of French explorer René Caillié, Olivier himself explored much of ""Lower and Middle Guinea"". He visited Labé in 1875 and traveled to Timbo by way of Boké twice, in 1880 and 1888.He lived many years in the Labé and Timbo regions, and persuaded the almamy, the leader of the imamate of Futa Jallon, to grant him sizable territorial concessions. (He had coins struck while trying to establish his own realm in the Fouta Djallon region in what is now Guinea.) The concessions were taken away from him, but they played a part in the creation of a French protectorate over the Fouta Djallon area.Later, he settled down in Conakry. The Sandervalia district of the city is named after him.At some point, King Luís I of Portugal bestowed on him the title comte de Sanderval. Novel The King of Kahel (French: Le Roi de Kahel) is a 2008 French-language novel by Guinean author Tierno Monénembo which is loosely based on Olivier's life. It won the 2008 prix Renaudot.

Cathal O'Shannon,Irish writers,Writers,"Cathal O'Shannon (9 June 1890 – 4 October 1969) was an Irish politician, trade unionist and journalist. Early years Charles Francis Shannon was born in Randalstown, County Antrim, he was the third child of Charles and Alice Shannon. As a child the family moved to his mother's hometown of Draperstown, County Londonderry where his father worked for the railway line. Growing up, both his family and locality influenced his interest in trade unionism, the Irish language, and Irish Republicanism. He was educated at Draperstown national school and St Columb's College, Derry. It was at Columb's that he studied history as a subject and developed an interest in journalism. Following the death of his father he moved to Belfast where he began to train for the civil service. Republicanism and the Revolutionary era It was while he was in Belfast that he became a member of Conradh na Gaeilge and started writing articles for the Peasant, Sinn Féin and An Claidheamh Soluis publications. It also around this time, under the influence of Seán Mac Diarmada, Bulmer Hobson and Denis McCullough, that he became a member of the secret Republican society the Irish Republican Brotherhood as well as operator of the Belfast branch of Na Fianna Éireann, the Irish Nationalist boy scout group.By 1910 he had abandoned his studies and was working as a clerk in the Belfast office of the Heysham Steamship Company. It was while working at this job that O'Shannon witnessed labour disputes and sectarian divides between Protestant and Catholic workers. This drew him further into trade unionism and socialism. In 1912 he joined the Irish Transport and General Workers' Union, where he became a full-time assistant to James Connolly, one of the most important figures in the Irish trade union movement. It was under Connolly's influence that he joined the Socialist Party of Ireland, which Connolly had founded.In 1913, he was one of the founders of Irish Volunteers in Belfast. On Easter Sunday 1916, he mobilised with a hundred Volunteers at Coalisland, County Tyrone; they dispersed when there were no orders from Dublin. He was later arrested by the British authorities who interned him until the General Amnesty of 1917. He was arrested during the German Plot and went on a hunger strike. He was released seventeen days later. Following his release, O'Shannon began to operate out of cities such as Dublin and Cork, where he worked to hold together the ITGWU in the wake of Connolly's death. At the same time, Connolly's death had caused a power struggle with the Socialist Party of Ireland which had been largely inactive since the outbreak of World War I. O'Shannon, William O'Brien and Sean O'Casey had come to form one wing of the party, while James' son Roddy Connolly and Seán McLoughlin formed another. Both sides sought to woo the Bolsheviks of the on-going Russian Revolution. By 1921 Connolly's faction won over control of the party and expelled O'Shannon and O'Brien, whom they branded as ""Reformists"", and they then departed for the Labour Party. Alongside Labour Leader Thomas Johnson, O'Shannon helped draft the Democratic Programme, a declaration of economic and social principles that the newly created Dáil Eireann was asked to follow in return for Labour not contesting the 1918 Irish general election. O'Shannon aided the drafting of the programme despite his opposition to the idea of Labour not contesting the election. O'Shannon was becoming increasingly militant, now declaring himself ""an Irish Bolshevik"" and stating that ""the soviet idea was the only one that would confer freedom on Ireland"". O'Shannon supported the outbreak of the ""Irish soviets"", which were a number of actions by striking Irish workers between 1919 and 1920 where they seized control of their workplaces, declared themselves ""Soviets"" and either ran these workplaces without input from their owners or negotiated for better conditions. In 1920 O'Shannon began travelling to Britain to speak on behalf of the Irish Revolution, trying to win the support of the British Labour movement. It was in April 1920 that he was arrested and imprisoned for this, on the charge of sedition, and sent to Mountjoy Prison. However, he was released following an 8 day hunger strike.In October 1921 the peace talks which would eventually lead to the Anglo-Irish Treaty had begun. O'Shannon called for the negotiators not to compromise on the recognition of the Irish Republic. When a deal was announced, O'Shannon supported ""neutrality"" by the Labour movement in the Irish Civil War and viewed the entire affair as a ""distraction"", stating instead that the real war which should have been fought should have been a class war. Elected as a TD Despite his reputation as a firebrand socialist radical, O'Shannon was elected to Dáil Éireann at the 1922 general election as a Labour Party TD for Louth–Meath with almost 40% of the vote, twice that of the candidate in second place. He became deputy leader of Labour in the Dáil and as deputy leader he was highly critical of the Cosgrave government, particular on the issue of the public safety bill which granted the National Army extraordinary powers in dealing with the Anti-Treaty IRA. He also spoke out at the execution of anti-treaty prisoners such as Rory O'Connor and Liam Mellows following the Battle of the Four Courts, which he condemned as ""the greatest crime...committed in Ireland within these last ten years"".He failed to be re-elected when he stood for the Louth constituency at the 1923 general election amid a national collapse of the Labour party vote which saw their overall vote percentage half. Similarly, he was unable to bounce back in Meath at the September 1927 general elections. Later years No longer a TD, O'Shannon remained a prominent figure in Labour however and became to focus on trade unionism while editing The Voice of Labour and The Watchword from 1930 to 1932. In 1941 he became Secretary of the Irish Trades Union Congress, and afterwards of the Congress of Irish Unions. He served for twenty-three years, until his death, as one of the workers' representatives when the Labour Court was established in 1946. Personal life In 1924 O'Shannon married Margaret Doris Finn of Stockport, Cheshire, England. The two had met while O'Shannon was active in Britain during the war of independence. Together they had 3 children, one son and two daughters. Their son was Cathal O'Shannon who became a veteran Irish broadcaster and journalist and their daughters were Gráinne and Finola, who were both involved in acting and film production.He died in Dublin on 4 October 1969 in St Laurence's hospital, and was buried in Deans Grange Cemetery.

Theodhor Haxhifilipi,Albanian writers,Writers,"Theodhor Haxhifilipi also known as Dhaskal Todhri (Elbasan, active 1730–1805) was a teacher from Elbasan, who is credited as an inventor of an original Albanian alphabet. The Todhri script, as is called because of him, according to Kostandin Kristoforidhi, was either invented by Theodor, or brought by him from Voskopojë. Life Not much is known about Haxhifilipi's life. There are only a few documentary sources. Haxhifilipi was probably born in the Kala neighbourhood of Elbasan, from a family of silversmiths. According to George Von Hahn, he finished his studies at the New Academy of Voskopojë. This is how Albanologist Robert Elsie describes his life: One noted student of the New Academy in Voskopoja was Todhri (Theodor) Haxhifilipi (ca. 1730-1805), also known as Dhaskal Todhri from Elbasan, who, after training in Voskopoja, taught at the Greek school in his native Elbasan, hence the name Dhaskal (teacher). The German language scholar Johann Georg von Hahn (1811-1869), who visited Albania in the first half of the nineteenth century, refers to him as having translated not only the Old Testament but also the New Testament and other religious works. Most of his writings were unfortunately destroyed by fire during an epidemic in 1827 such that we can neither confirm nor disprove Hahn’s assertion about the Bible translations. Among the surviving fragments ascribed to Haxhifilipi, preserved both in the Central State Archives in Tirana and in the Austrian National Library in Vienna (Ser. Nova 3351), are Albanian translations of an Orthodox Book of Hours and of Mesha e Shën Jon Gojarit (The liturgy of St John Chrysostom). Haxhifilipi is the author of a poem written in 1774 in Voskopojë, and published in a prayer book dedicated to Saint John Vladimir. Haxhifilipi was a teacher at the local Greek school in Elbasan. According to Robert Elsie, the Alphabet was used until 1930 in Elbasan. The alphabet and other works It is not sure if Haxhifilipi invented the script, or was he the first one to bring it to Elbasan. According to Dhimitër Shuteriqi, the Todhri script could have been invented by Gregory of Durrës, who was also a teacher at the New Academy of Voskopojë, where Haxhifilipi was a student. The earliest dated text in Todhri's script is Radhua Hesapesh (daybook) of a local merchant partnership known as Jakov Popa i Vogël dhe Shokët (English: Jakov Popa Junior and Friends). The entries in Todhri's script start on 10 August 1795 and continue until 1797. An even older text written in Todhri script is discovered recently in family notebook in Elbasan, dated 1st of January 1780. Leopold Geitler (1847–1885) and Slovenian scholar Rajko Nahtigal (1877–1958) subsequently studied the script, concluding that it was derived primarily from the Roman cursive and Greek cursive from the 18th century.Other older texts, possibly written by Todhri himself, cannot be dated or confirmed.

Anna Alchuk,Russian writers,Writers,"Anna Alchuk (28 March 1955 – 21 March 2008) was a Russian poet and visual artist. An admirer summarized her work as ""a free-spirited romp across complex and significant ideas about personhood, identity, representation, linguistic performance, and political action.""She was married for 33 years to the philosopher Michail Ryklin. At the time of her death the couple were living in Berlin where Ryklin was employed as a visiting professor at the university. The assessment that Alchuk's death had been a suicide was generally accepted, but did not go entirely unquestioned.Anna Alchuk was the name under which she worked as an artist, and by which she is identified in many English language sources. However, fuller variants of her name are also used in some sources. Life Anna Alchuk Mikhalchuk (А́нна Алекса́ндровна Михальчу́к) was born into a Jewish family in Bosjnjakovo in the Sakhalin Oblast in the Soviet Far East. Her parents were working on Sakhalin as geologists. Anna grew up in another rich mining region, in Vorkuta in the North Urals. She identified with her grandmother whom she never met, since the old lady spent the last thirty years of her life locked away in a psychiatric institution.In 1973 she met Michail Ryklin whom she married in 1975. While Ryklin worked for his doctorate which focused on Claude Lévi-Strauss and Jean-Jacques Rousseau, between 1973 and 1978 Alchuk studied History at Lomonosov University (as Moscow's principal university was known at that time). During the build-up to the Dissolution of the Soviet Union, in 1987 and 1988 she was a co-publisher of the samizdat publications ""Paradigma"" (""Парадигма"") and ""MDP"" (""МДП""). In 1983 Alchuk's mother, Maja Koljada, had been denounced and accused of ""spreading untrue facts, contrary to better knowledge, which denigrate the Soviet state and social system"". Koljada had been sent away to a labour camp hundreds of kilometers away from her family.Towards the end of the 1980s she got together with a group of Moscow artists and conceptualist poets, to take part in the exhibitions of the new conceptual art movement. Later she participated in music and poetry stage performances, for instance with the cult musician Sergey Letov and the Three-O group. Her own first volume of poetry was published in 1994. During this period she was the organiser of numerous exhibitions and performances in which music and poetry were combined. Anna Alchuk was a member of the Russian section of PEN International and of the Academy of Zaum. Her poems and visual works were reproduced in Draft (almanac) (a Russian language literary almanac published annually in New York) and New Literary Review. Her essays and articles featured in leading Russian journals, including Foreign Literature. She was the editor-compiler of a collection of articles entitled ""Женщина и визуальные знаки"" (""Woman and visual signs"") which appeared in 2000. During the final years of the twentieth century, hers became an increasingly international presence in the contemporary arts world, featuring in exhibitions not just in Russia, but also in Britain, Germany, Hungary and Sweden.Life turned bitter early in 2003. In January an exhibition opened in Moscow under the challenging title Watch out: Religion. The focus of the exhibition was on the church. A few days after it opened, on 18 January, the exhibition was trashed by six people purporting to represent Christian Orthodox believers. The works of the 40 exhibitors were destroyed with paint. A statement appeared on the wall: ""May you be damned"". Two of the vandals, Lyukshin and Zyakin, were arrested at the scene and a criminal trial took place. What appalled many in Russia and, as news of the trial spread, many international observers, was the fact that the authorities proceeded not against the vandals but against the exhibition organisers, Yuri Samodurov and Ludmila Vasilovskaya. A third person was on trial, one of the more high-profile exhibitors, Anna Alchuk Mikhalchuk. (On 23 August 2003 a Moscow court determined that Lyukshin and Zyakin had no case to answer.) The lengthy trial and the events surrounding it hit Alchuk badly. Her husband was able to chronicle their experiences. Overnight their circle of friends halved in size. They were avoided. Alchuk found herself identified in the Russian press not as an adventurous artist and lyric poet but as a political figurehead of opposition. There was no protection offered from the constant anonymous threats, many of which were couched in nationalist and anti-semitic terms. The experience of social isolation and the growing belief that if the authorities said she was guilty of something then she must be, tore away at her self-image. It was the start of a long period of destabilisation. (The outcome of the trial was that Samodurov and Vasilovskaya were found guilty of inciting religious and ethic hostility under Article 282 of the Criminal Code. Each was fined one thousand rubles. Alchuk was found ""not guilty"" and acquitted.) Constant threats by telephone and by letter continued: the threats were mostly of violence. Leaving the house became an ordeal. There were online death threats. The murder of Anna Politkovskaya shook her badly. Michail Ryklin later wrote, ""Once acquitted by the court, she saw herself facing a community for whom the things for which she had fought and made sacrifices (initially it almost seemed and if this was about a common call for freedom of artistic expression) had completely lost their meaning. Over these years the art scene resigned itself to its defeat and even managed to profit considerably as a result. It was, it transpired, far easier to endure being a target of religious fanatics than having to put up with the repressive passivity of most of her fellow artists."" Meanwhile, her daughter and grandchild in Moscow waited in vain for Alchuk to call. Over the next few years Ryklin and Alchuk concluded that they no longer had a future in Moscow. In November 2007 they moved to Berlin: Michail Ryklin accepted a post as a visiting professor at the Humboldt University. Death On March 21, 2008 Anna Alchuk left the couple's Berlin apartment, telling her husband she was going to the shops to buy washing powder. It was a public holiday and the shops would be closed, but Ryklin, his nose in a book, did not register that till later. It was wet, cold and windy and she was dressed appropriately. Three hours later he noticed she had left her Mobile phone behind. Three weeks later, on 12 April, he was visited by two detectives. A body had been found in the Spree. He recognised the wedding ring when he was shown a photograph of it. Stones had been found in the coat pockets, together with a water-damaged picture of Manjushri. (The couple shared an interest in Buddhism.) Blood tests indicated a sleeping drug intake twenty times the doze conventionally prescribed for insomnia. The larynx was damaged. There was a puncture on the right side of the body with a broken needle in it. A hat had been drawn down firmly over the forehead and eyes.The day after his wife disappeared Michail Ryklin shared some ideas with the investigating authorities in a letter. He urged them to take more seriously the possibility that there might be a political aspect to her disappearance: ""Through her critical engagement with Russian society, and because of her Jewish provenance, Mrs Mikhalchuk was exposed to daily repression and threats of violence. Crimes of political violence against critics of the Russian government have increased massively in recent years. So you should not rule out a politically motivated or antisemitic crime in this case.""In 2014 Michail Ryklin published a book, described by one reviewer as ""a record of grief and love"", about his late wife. He had worked through police investigation reports of around 100 pages. He had worked through 27 numbered note books in which Anna, like most serious writers, had confided her thoughts and dreams, insights and, increasingly, her nightmares. He had discovered many things about Anna, about himself, and about their marriage, that he had not known before. One conclusion that he had quickly reached for himself was that, in an immediate sense, his wife's death had indeed been a suicide.

She was a member of Parliament from 1994–2006.She was the vice-chairwoman of the VVD party in the House of Representatives from 2003–2006. In 2006, the chair of the VVD party in the House of Representatives, Jozias van Aartsen, stepped down because of the poor VVD election results in the 2006 Dutch municipal election. De Vries followed van Aartsen's example because she felt ""connected"" to him. Fellow VVD Parliament member Edith Schippers succeeded her as vice-chairwoman. In the House of Representatives, she was associated for her party with economical and financial affairs like pensions, unemployment, and the like. She was chairwoman of the House of Representatives Commission for Government Expenses and was part of the Srebrenica Commission, which investigated the errors made by the Dutch UN army unit regarding the Srebrenica massacre in the Bosnian Srebrenica enclave. When the second Balkenende Cabinet fell and new general elections were announced, de Vries declared she wouldn't return to Parliament after the elections and left Parliament.

Uhwudong,Korean writers,Writers,"Eowudong or Uhwudong (어우동, 於宇同; 1440 - 18 October 1480), also known as Eoeuludong (어을우동, 於乙宇同), née Park (박, 朴), was a Korean dancer, writer, artist, and poet from a noble family in the Joseon Dynasty of the 15th century. Most of her work has not been preserved. She is described to be one of the evil women from the Joseon Dynasty along with Queen Munjeong, Jang Nok-su, and Royal Noble Consort Hui. Life Born as Park Gu-ma (박구마, 朴丘麻), Uhwudong was from was a noble family, the Eumseong Park clan (음성 박씨, 陰城 朴氏), of the Joseon Dynasty. She married Yi Dong, Prince Taegang (태강수 이동, 泰江守 李仝), the great-grandson of Queen Wongyeong and King Taejong. She was forced to divorce him on account of adultery charges and subsequently she became an active poet, writer, artist, and dancer. She was noted for her exceptional beauty, dancing, singing talent, poetry, quick wit and charm, and extraordinary intellect. Sex scandal and execution In 1480, she was put on trial for adultery. She was charged with having committed adultery with multiple male partners, including royal relatives, court officials and slaves.During this time period, the position of women deteriorated in Korea with the introduction of Confucian gender segregation, and there was an increasing severity in the persecution of women who committed adultery, and particularly noblewomen. Several such cases are known, such as those of Yu Gam-dong, who was sentenced to become a slave kisaeng, and Geumeumdong and Dongja, both noblewomen who were punished for having committed adultery with male relatives. Yi Gu-ji was also an example of committing adultery. The case of Uhwudong was however the perhaps most infamous of all, and became a famous scandal involving many men of high standing. The case ended with her conviction and execution. The death penalty for female adultery was formally introduced by king Jungjong of Joseon in 1513.

Claude Phillips,English writers,Writers,"Sir Claude Phillips (29 January 1846 – 9 August 1924) was a British writer, art historian and critic for The Daily Telegraph, Manchester Guardian and other publications during the late 19th century. He was the first keeper of the Wallace Collection at Hertford House, writing its first catalogue, and held that post from 1900 until his retirement in 1911 whereupon he was knighted for his service. Phillips was considered one of the most eminent critics in Victorian Britain, and his numerous scholarly and art history books were widely read. Biography The second son of Robert Abraham Phillips and Helen Levy, Claude Phillips was born at Gloster Villa, Regent's Park, London on 29 January 1846. He was educated in France and Germany prior to studying law at the University of London. He originally embarked on a career as a solicitor and was called to the bar in 1883. As a young barrister-at-law, he was often called to Italy on business and while there developed an interest in the arts.Phillips eventually left the legal profession and became a music critic for The Daily Telegraph in the late 1880s. From 1885 to 1896, he was the English correspondent for the Gazette des Beaux-Arts in Paris. Among other Victorian era publications he wrote for included the Manchester Guardian, the Magazine of Art, the Academy and The Art Journal. Phillips became a widely known scholar in the field and later wrote several works on Joshua Reynolds, Antoine Watteau and Titian. One of his best known books was The Life of Sir Joshua Reynolds (1894).After a particularly well-received article on Rodin, he became a full-time art critic for The Daily Telegraph in 1897. That same year, Phillips was appointed the first keeper of the Wallace Collection and spent the next three years preparing its catalogue prior to its opening at Hertford House in 1900. He held that post until his retirement 14 years later. In 1914 he was included in a caricature by Edmund Dulac which was part of the Wallace Collection. The humorous painting is called ""Le Legende de Joseph"".Phillips was succeeded by Dugald Sutherland MacColl, and received a knighthood for his service shortly afterwards. Phillips died on 9 August 1924 at the age of 78. A collection of his essays, Emotion in Art (1925), was published posthumously the following year. The caricature of him was eventually given to the UK through the Art Fund, a charity that Phillips helped to set up.

Zainal Abidin Ahmad (writer),Malaysian writers,Writers,"Tan Sri Zainal Abidin bin Ahmad (16 September 1895 – 23 October 1973) or better known by the moniker Za'aba (alternatively spelled Za'ba), was a Malaysian writer and linguist. He modernised the Malay language with the publication of a series of grammar books entitled Pelita Bahasa in 1936 at the Sultan Idris Training College. The book contained guidelines in modernising the structure of classical Malay language, transforming it into the Malay language that is in use today. The most significant change was the switch from the conventional passive to the modern active form of syntax. He also devised the Za'aba Spelling system for Malay, which was adopted as the official orthography of Malay in Malaya and continued to be used by its successor states Malaysia, Singapore and Brunei until 1972, when it was replaced by New Rumi Spelling. Biography Zainal Abidin was born on 16 September 1895 in Kampung Bukit Kerdas, Batu Kikir, Jempol in the state of Negeri Sembilan; the eldest of three children. His mother, Intan Awaluddin (1877–1907) was of Minangkabau descent, while his father Ahmad Ibrahim (1862–1927) was a Buginese from a well-off family in the Riau Islands — the latter being the only literate person in the village. Zainal Abidin, however, learned to read and write by himself from the age of five, practising his writing on young banana leaves with a twig as a stylus. This caught the interest of his father, who decided to buy him a writing slate and some chalk. This further motivated Zainal's affinity for writing and helped to finetune his writing skills later on.Za'aba initially received his early education at a Malay school in Batu Kikir at the age of 12. His academic excellence allowed him to advance by two grades to Year 3. His father transferred him to a nearby school in Linggi in 1909, in the hopes that his son would become an ulama and learn the fields of Arabic language and Islamic jurisprudence, among other things. He then continued his study at St. Paul's Institution, Seremban, becoming the first Malay to take and pass the Senior Cambridge test in 1915.Za'aba started his career as a teacher at: 1916: English College Johore Bahru 1918: Malay College Kuala Kangsar 1923: Education Department, Kuala Lumpur 1924: Maktab Perguruan Sultan Idris, Tanjung Malim 1939: Information Department, Singapore until 1942 1942: School of Oriental and African Studies, University of London until 1951 1954: University of Malaya, Singapore until 1959.Za'aba loved reading and had a highly commendable talent in writing, with most of his writings published in local newspapers and magazines. He published a series of monographs in regard to the Malay language, including Pelita Bahasa (English: The Light of the Language) and Ilmu Mengarang Melayu (English: Malay Writing Skills). His other writings include a compilation of translated Shakespeare works, Cerita-Cerita Shakespeare, that was published by Percetakan Gudang Chap in Singapore. Za'aba wrote a lot of essays that were social criticisms against the ills affecting contemporary Malay society and against British colonial rule at the time. His hidden hand had a role in the formation of the United Malays National Organisation, a political party that had played an influential role in Malaysian politics and was one of the ruling parties in the country until the 14th General Election on May 9, 2018, when UMNO lost to the opposition, Pakatan Harapan, led by former 4th Prime Minister Tun Dr Mahathir Mohamad.
