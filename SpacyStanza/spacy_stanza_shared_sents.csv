623,"In the 1960s, Rhee's political regime ended and anti-imperialism sentiments redoubled, followed by scholars pursuing a new autonomous history of Korea, and revived the term minjok."
624,"Shin was taught various Neo-Confucian books and concepts by his grandfather, and later enrolled in the Confucian academy Seonggyungwan,: 441–2  receiving a doctoral degree in 1905."
625,"Shin described a slow fall of the minjok, primarily attributing a high point to King Muyeol of Silla, and then descent through the fall of Balhae and slow fracturing of Korean social unity through politics and war."
626,"Shin died while in solitary confinement at Lüshun Prison of a brain hemorrhage on the 21st of February, 1936.: 156 : 447  The Republic of Korea posthumously awarded Shin with the ""Presidential Order of Merit for National Foundation"" in 1962 and citizenship on April 13, 2013."

629,"If Shin had knowingly presented a Korean-ized Divine Comedy as an authentic work of Korean fiction, it would be an adulteration of the minjok historiography project by Shin's own standards of ethno-cultural autonomy."
630,Criticism Standards of education Shin Chae-ho's high standards of education and early enrollment of children in school (at age 4) were criticized as excessive.
631,"For Shin, space, culture, and patriotism became inseparable.: 239  A worry of some Koreans is their ethno-cultural continuation, and the loss of ""Korean-ness"" as Koreans either travel abroad or adopt foreign customs."

633,"The new South Korean government favoured the term kukka (국가), which implied loyalty to the Republic of Korea, over Shin's minjok (민족)."
634,"Within Shin's work, the Manchurian-Korean Buyeo minjok is interpreted as the standard of measure for historical progress in Korea.: 34  Shin described a racial history of conflict between the various races of East Asia, as well as a political history."
635,"This is aggravated by the fact that Shin had few, if any, compelling references for his historical claims, making his boundaries largely arbitrary or folk-history based.: 31 Dream Sky borrowed from Dante's Divine Comedy Shin Chae-ho's Dream Sky at times resembles Dante's Divine Comedy."
636,Thought The Minjok and Korean ethnic nationalism Shin Chae-ho wrote extensively on a theory of ethnic history which sought to challenge traditional border concepts in Korea and encourage Korean nationalism.
637,"His pen name was ""Dansaeng"", which he later changed to ""Danjae""."
638,"However, his own works consistently employed territorial terms, boundaries, borders that only differ by how Shin justified them by a very ancient Korea, while the ""territorial historians'"" terms are usually traced to younger Chinese courts."
639,"Shin did not describe Korea as the ""victor"" of these racial battles."
640,"The minjok as a more basal concept than the gukga and did not substantially change between generations, whereas the gukga could change between kingdoms, government, and rules.: 40 By defining the minjok as a rich and powerful ethnic history, Shin constructed an anti-imperialism and anti-colonialism social defence."
641,"The term minjok was decried as politically unacceptable by Shin's old acquaintance from the Provisional Government, and now the first president of South Korea, Syngman Rhee."
642,"For Shin, ""if one dismisses the minjok, there is no history""; to ignore or to down-play the minjok was to devitalize history itself.: 32 Within the greater minjok history of a nation there was a host race, the chujok (주족); the identification of the chujok was necessary for tracing the authentic history of a nation, and solidified an ethnocentric national history."
