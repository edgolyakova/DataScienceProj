Oldřich Pelčák (born November 2, 1943, in Zlín, Czechoslovakia) was a Czech cosmonaut and engineer. He graduated from Gagarin Air Force Military Academy. In 1976, Pelčák was selected as backup of Vladimír Remek for the Soyuz 28 mission. They were the first cosmonauts who were neither Americans nor Soviets.
