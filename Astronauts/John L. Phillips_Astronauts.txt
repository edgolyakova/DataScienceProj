On August 18, 2005, Phillips and Krikalev completed a five-hour spacewalk to retrieve several experiments and install a video camera for the new docking procedure.
Phillips and Krikalev, along with Space Flight Participant Gregory Olsen, returned to Earth aboard Soyuz TMA-6 on October 11, 2005.
STS-119 (Space Shuttle Discovery, March 15 to 28, 2009).
STS-119 was a 12-day mission to the ISS flown during March 2009.
