He was also editor of Narodne novine (1862-1864) and Danica (1863-1864) newspapers, and was the first editor of magazines Domobran (1864) and Vienac (1869). He also wrote historical and philosophical essays, political articles, poetry, short stories, novels, travel literature and biographies of notable Croats. His contemporaries were especially fond of his popular history articles dealing with Croatian history.
