His earliest publications, the Revels Plays edition of Christopher Marlowe's Doctor Faustus, co-edited with David Bevington, and A Textual Companion to Doctor Faustus appeared in the early 1990s. The latter was reviewed by Colin Wilcockson, who noted that "Rasmussen demonstrates the reversibility of many arguments about original text/memorial construction." Complete Works of William Shakespeare Rasmussen, along with Sir Jonathan Bate edited the Royal Shakespeare Company's Complete Works of William Shakespeare, which was published in 2007. A review in The New York Times observed that "two eminent Shakespeareans, Jonathan Bate and Eric Rasmussen, have applied modern editing techniques and recent scholarship to correct and update the First Folio". According to a review in The Guardian, "thanks to Bate and Rasmussen, we now have a rendering of The Complete Works that, in a rare publishing achievement, would also give complete satisfaction to the author himself". The edition received the Falstaff Award for Best Shakespearean Publication of the Year in 2007 and was translated into Chinese. The book also gathered various mixed reviews including one in Shakespeare Quarterly stating that the "claims made about the project, with respect to both the text and the RSC, are not persuasive. In the end, the whole enterprise is less exciting and less exacting than it might have been”. The Shakespeare Thefts: In Search of the First Folios In 2011, Rasmussen published his book The Shakespeare Thefts: In Search of the First Folios, which was reviewed as "light and lively" and "a highly accessible read". According to Eleanor Brown, "you don’t have to be a Shakespeare fan or a rare book expert to enjoy The Shakespeare Thefts: In Search of the First Folios". Another review stated that "the author also provides a terrific appendix, which readers should not skip, that tells how Elizabethans printed books and how the First Folio came to be." According to Jeremy Dibbell, "the idea behind The Shakespeare Thefts—to profile stolen copies of the First Folio—is a fantastic one, and Rasmussen is at his best when doing just that". William Shakespeare & Others: Collaborative Plays Rasmussen co-edited William Shakespeare & Others: Collaborative Plays' with Sir Jonathan Bate, which was published in 2013. The book was the recipient of Falstaff Award for Best Shakespearean Publication of the Year in 2013 and gathered various reviews. According to Diana E. Henderson from MIT, "the volume in its entirety is valuable for its provocations and perceptions as well as the collected plays therein" and that "Rasmussen's modern-spelling editions will help plays such as the once wildly popular Mucedorus gain a new readership".A review in Australian Book Review stated that "this view of Shakespeare as a remote and solitary genius scarcely matches the known evidence". Rasmussen's book has also been reviewed by The Wall Street Journal and The Washington Post. Studying Shakespeare’s Contemporaries: A Guide to the Major Plays of the Renaissance In 2014, Rasmussen along with Lars Engle published the book, Studying Shakespeare's Contemporaries: A Guide to the Major Plays of the Renaissance. According to Michael D. Bristol, "Studying Shakespeare's Contemporaries explores many of the anthologized plays in broader thematic contexts that correlate nicely with the state of the art in contemporary Shakespeare interpretation and criticism".
