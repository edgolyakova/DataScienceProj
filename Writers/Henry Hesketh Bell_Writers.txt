Sir Henry Hesketh Joudou Bell  (17 December 1864 – 1 August 1952) was a British colonial administrator and author. Biography Henry Hesketh Joudou Bell was born on 17 December 1864 at Chambéry in the Savoie department of south-east France. He was the son of Henry Jean Antoine Joudou, a timber merchant, and Scotswoman Martha Bell. He had one sibling: Eléonore Marthe Joudou-Bell (1867-1951). Hesketh Bell's ancestry has been extensively researched.Bell was privately educated in the Channel Islands, and in Paris and Brussels.  In May 1882 he started work in Barbados, as third clerk in the office of the Governor of Barbados and the Leeward Islands, a post he was offered by family friend Sir William C. F. Robinson. From then on he rose through the system in the following posts: 1885-1889 – Grenada Inland Revenue Department 1890-94 – Supervisor of Customs in the Gold Coast Receiver General and Treasurer of the Bahamas 1899-1905 – Administrator Of Dominica 1905-08 – Commissioner (later, Governor) of the Uganda Protectorate 1909-11 – Governor of Northern Nigeria 1912-16 – Governor of the Leeward Islands 1916-24 – Governor of MauritiusIn December 2007, New Vision, a Ugandan online newspaper, posted a piece entitled “Hesketh Bell's Ugandan descendants” in which 72-year old Ketty Karuyonga Bell, said to be a great-granddaughter of the former Governor, tells her story.Hesketh Bell, who never married, is alleged to have had a son with a Mutooro woman, Maria Nyamuhaibona. The boy, John Dick Bell, is said to have been born on 18 December 1905. Hesketh Bell reportedly sent support for the boy, until he learned that John had had a serious accident when he was 10; support then stopped. John, who had 12 children, died of a heart attack in 1953. Bell's many achievements in Uganda have been summarised as a teaching aid.One of the most important was a scheme for suppressing sleeping sickness, which Bell proposed in August 1907. After the Treasury authorized the funds for the work, the natives were moved from the fly-infested district on the shores of Lake Victoria to healthy locations inland. The sick were placed in segregation camps to undergo the so-called atoxyl treatment; an estimated 20,000 people were dealt with. The shores of Lake Victoria were cleared of all vegetation, thus removing the presence of the tsetse fly.Hesketh Bell's vision for Uganda included major development of its railway. By 1909 to had battled hard for approval of two schemes: first, a line from Jinja, on the north shore of Lake Victoria to Kakindu and then to Lake Kioga; and, second, a direct line from Kampala to Lake Albert.Bell retired to Cannes in 1924, but he still travelled widely. In 1925-26 he made an extensive semi-official tour of the Far East to study French and Dutch systems of colonial government. His conclusions were published as Foreign colonial administration in the Far East in 1928, for which he was awarded the Gold Medal of the Royal Empire Society.
