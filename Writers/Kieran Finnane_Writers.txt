Books
In 2016 Finnane published her first book Trouble: on Trial in Central Australia. This book examines the complexities of life in Alice Springs, particularly the Alice Springs Town Camps, and what is revealed in the criminal court. The book attempts to dispassionately present the horrors of crimes committed in Central Australia, and is particularly focused on the violence of  Aboriginal men under the influence of alcohol, towards their wives, brothers and cousins and others. It was well-reviewed by journalist Barry Hill, who wrote: "Trouble is reporting in the liberal, Western mode at its best. It seeks to be compassionate, full of right love, you might say, but the love is conducted without falling into sentimentality, on the one hand, or in defensive historical polemic, on the other".Finnane's second book, Peace Crimes: Pine Gap, national security and dissent was published in August 2020. It looks at the closely-guarded and secretive military facility called Pine Gap, close to Alice Springs, with a particular focus on the arrest of the Peace Pilgrims, non-violent activists.
