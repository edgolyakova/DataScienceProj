His translations have included scientific works, books for children and two volumes of Marcel Proust's Ã€ la recherche du temps perdu (ANU, 1982 and Penguin, London, 2002). Grieve's translated second part of Proust's 7-part Remembrance of Things Past is the first completely new English translation since the 1920s. There were six other translators working on the other parts, for this project by Penguin. Grieve's Penguin translation received positive review from Alain de Botton who remarked: "... if one ends up with a favourite [of the 7 volumes] (mine was James Grieve, who did Volume 2)." Grieve is also the author of the language study text Dictionary of Contemporary French Connectors (Routledge, London, 1996). Grieve's translations have been illustrated by Petr Herel (Uncollected Works Press) and Phil Day (Finlay Press).
