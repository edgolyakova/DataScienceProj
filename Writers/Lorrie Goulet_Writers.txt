Lorrie Goulet (born August 17, 1925) is an American sculptor and painter, known primarily for her direct carving of stone and wood, and for works which often celebrate women, families and cultures. Goulet's works include philosophical and educational writings and books, and poetry. Goulet was educated at Black Mountain College from 1943 to 1944 and taught at the Art Students League of New York. She continues to create art, publish her writings, and teach in her studio in Chelsea, New York. Life and career Goulet's arts studies began when at age seven she met Aimee Voorhees at the Inwood Pottery Studio in 1932 and continued working with Voorhees for four formative years. Shortly thereafter, her family moved to Los Angeles, California, where she continued her education. In 1940 she became an apprentice to Jean Rose, a ceramicist in Southern California.In the autumn of 1943, Goulet entered Black Mountain College, North Carolina, where she studied painting and drawing with Josef Albers and weaving with Anni Albers. In the summer of 1944, she met Jose de Creeft, a visiting sculptor and instructor, and in November 1944, Goulet and de Creeft were married. Two years later, they acquired a farm in Hoosick Falls, New York, where they worked part of each year until 1968, and gave birth to artist Donna Maria de Creeft. Goulet's first solo exhibition was in New York, in 1948. Her work has been represented in group shows since 1948, among them, a number of Annual Exhibitions at the Whitney Museum of American Art, New York, and in the fine arts pavilion of the New York World's Fair of 1964/1965. Kennedy Galleries in New York began presenting her work in 1971, with regular solo exhibitions through to 1986. In 1998, she had a solo exhibition at the National Museum of Women in the Arts in Washington D.C. entitled Fifty Years of Making Sculpture. Her work continues to be presented by David Findlay Jr. Gallery, in solo and group exhibitions, and the Harmon Meek Gallery in Naples, Florida. Goulet's first position as a teacher of sculpture was with the Museum of Modern Art's Peoples Center, New York, in 1957, and she also began teaching privately in that year. From 1961 to 1975 she was on the faculty of The New School, New York, and began teaching at the Art Students League of New York starting in 1981 until 2004.
