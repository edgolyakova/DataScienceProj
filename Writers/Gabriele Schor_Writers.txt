The Feminist Avantgarde Gabriele Schor shows the importance of the feminist avantgarde of the 1970s in the history of art. Female artists claim their position as artists and their recognition by the art world. They also claim their position and recognition in society. They advocate self-determination and the reappropriation of the image of women in an artistic world dominated by men. They are the expression and reflection of a movement that challenges female role models and the social assignments of women in society.Female artists take on new media such as photography, experimental film, video art, performance and action, collage and installations. They come together for performative actions and work together to organize their own exhibitions. Artists of the feminist avant-garde question and challenge the traditional image and role of women. They question art and society, the vision of women. They propose new images with which women can identify. They mark a break in the history of art. The themes addressed are the roles of women as mothers, housewives, wives, female sexuality and appropriation of the body, violence against women. They also take up political issues such as the Vietnam War.In 2019, the exhibition in Barcelona at the Center for Contemporary Culture links the concerns of the feminist avantgarde of the 1970s and the current movement with Catalan artists such as Eugenia Balcells, Eulalia Grau, Fine Miralles Nobell and Angels Ribé.
