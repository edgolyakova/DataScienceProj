Bywater was the inspiration for his close friend Douglas Adams's character Dirk Gently.Bywater was previously identified as a young fogey. In The Young Fogey Handbook (Poole, Dorset: Javelin Books, 1985), author Suzanne Lowry writes: "Michael Bywater, 30-year old Punch columnist and former trendy who once worked in films, made bold to criticise Burberrys for the inferior quality of their product - the trench coats are not what they were in the days of the trenches. Burberrys riposted that indeed they could live up to their past, and made Bywater a coat to the 1915 design devised by Kitchener and Burberry â€“ complete with camel hair lining to protect a gentleman officer's flesh on the field..."

Games, books, music
In the mid-1980s, Bywater co-designed and co-wrote several interactive fiction games. He collaborated with Douglas Adams on Bureaucracy and the never-completed Milliways: The Restaurant At The End Of The Universe for Infocom, and with Anita Sinclair on Jinxter for Magnetic Scrolls. He revisited computer games in the late 1990s as a member of the writing team on another Douglas Adams project, Starship Titanic.
Bywater's book Lost Worlds, on the human tendency to nostalgia, appeared in 2004. His subsequent Big Babies, on the infantilisation of Western culture, was published in November 2006. A book on his journeys round the Australian Outback in a Cessna 172 continues to be a work in progress, due out "soon".
