Vesna Parun (Croatian pronunciation: [v̞ê̞sna pâruːn]; 10 April 1922 – 25 October 2010) was a Croatian poet. Biography After schooling in Zlarin, Šibenik, and Split, she studied Romance languages and philosophy at the Faculty of Humanities and Social Sciences, University of Zagreb. From 1947 she was a free artist, writing poetry, essays, criticism, and children's literature. She translated works from Slovene, German, French, and Bulgarian. Her first book of poetry Dawns and Whirlwinds (1947) 'contrasts the youthful vibrancy, love and nature with death and the destructive forces of war'. It received negative reviews from the socialist-realist critics, who saw it as "apolitical" and "decadent", possibly for not conforming to tendencies to ideologize post-World War II poetry.Starting with the poetry collection Black Olive Tree (1955), love was the primary motif of her written opus. Incessantly working on romantic lyrical poetry, from the 1960s on, she published satiric verses directed at politics and the erotic. She wrote more than 20 works for children alone, the most prominent and widely performed being Mačak Džingiskan i Miki Trasi (1968). She also wrote several drama pieces, including Marija i mornar (1960). She is the first woman in Croatia who earned her money solely by being a writer. She published, printed, and illustrated some of her own books.
