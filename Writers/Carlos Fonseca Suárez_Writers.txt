Works
Colonel Lágrimas
His first novel, Colonel Lágrimas, published in Spain and Latin America by Anagrama and in English by Restless Books, received critical acclaim and was praised by The Guardian as a “dazzling debut” and by Valerie Miles, in The New York Times Book Review as a “gorgeous opera prima” Loosely based on the life story of the eccentric mathematician Alexander Grothendieck, it tells the story of a man attempting to compose a total encyclopaedia.
Natural History
His second novel was published in Spain and Latin America by Anagrama as Museo animal, and in English (translated by Megan McDowell) by Farrar, Straus and Giroux. The New York Times, writing about the novel, said that “its plotting and Delphic aura suggest the paranoiac glitter of Don DeLillo, the cosmopolitan dread of Roberto Bolaño and the imaginative elasticity of Ricardo Piglia.”  Kirkus Reviews, in a Starred review, described it as "an elegant meditation on art, inconstancy, and hiding, with a deftly woven subtext of camouflage that emerges as the narrative progresses."Austral
His third novel was published in Spain and Latin America by Anagrama as Austral, and is forthcoming in English (translated by Megan McDowell) by Farrar, Straus and Giroux (US) and MacLehose Press (UK).  It was described by the Spanish Newspaper El Mundo as “a brilliant inquiry in the archive of memory.” La Lucidez del Miope
He is also the author of a book of essays, where he writes about the works of writers that have inspired him like Ricardo Piglia, W.G. Sebald, Roberto Bolaño, Marta Aponte and Enrique Vila-Matas. This book won the Premio Nacional Aquileo J. Echevarría, Costa Rica’s National Prize of Literature, in the Essay Category.
