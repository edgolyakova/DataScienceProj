Ideas, Influences, and Political Stances
Racial Issues
Frederick Joseph frequently discusses racial issues and calls out the absence of accountability. In a discussion with Forbes about social media's anti-blackness, he states that the "algorithms were designed by White engineers with White individuals in mind" and that White consumers are "upholding systems of inequity."
