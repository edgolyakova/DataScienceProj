Afterwards he collaborated on a number of published works. In 1988 he published his first novel, Summer Road (Natsukaidô-Samârôdo), followed by various other fantasy books, often set in large cities or characterized by a surreal streak. Hayami also worked on a number of novelizations of science fiction or horror manga and anime. In the latter field, his work on the tie-ins for the anime series Vampire Princess Miyu became so popular that the original characters and situations were in later entries of the series modified to account for his personal additions to the canon. == References ==
