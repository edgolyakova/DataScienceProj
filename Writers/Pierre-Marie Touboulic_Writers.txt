The experiment was continued in 1839 for at least three months on the ramparts of Fort Bouguen with the participation of about 800 people. The press of the time (Armoricain) suggested possible uses for transport of convicts, the sick, etc. The Brest cable car was called the Touboulic Express by the city of Brest in 2014.
