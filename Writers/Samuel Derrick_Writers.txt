Samuel Derrick (1724â€“1769) was an Irish author. He became known as a hack writer in London, where he gained wide literary connections.

Life
Born in Dublin, Derrick served an apprenticeship with a linen draper, and after that failed as an actor. He then turned to writing.Derrick knew Samuel Johnson, who had a soft spot for him, and he helped Johnson in researching John Dryden's life. He also knew James Boswell in his early days in London. He was supported by Tobias Smollett, who gave him employment as amanuensis and on The Critical Review.He is thought to have been the original compiler of Harris's List of Covent Garden Ladies, an annual directory of London prostitutes beginning in 1757.Two years after the death of Beau Nash in 1761, Derrick was appointed master of the ceremonies at Bath. He was employed there, and in a similar  position in Tunbridge Wells, until his death on 28 March 1769. There was no lack of criticism, with James Quin in particular (who had wanted the position in Bath) undermining Derrick.
