John Clark (died 1807) was a Scottish land agent, Gaelic scholar and writer.

Life
Clark was a Highlander, who was drawn into the controversy over the Ossian poems written by James Macpherson, by a chance meeting. He worked for two decades in Wales, in particular on developing the road system, and was the steward of Viscount Hereford. He died at Pembroke in 1807. He was a Fellow of the Society of Antiquaries of Scotland.

Clark published:
Works of the Caledonian Bards, Edinburgh, 1778, collection of supposed translations of Highland poems
