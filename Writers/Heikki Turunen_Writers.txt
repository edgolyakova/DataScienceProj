Heikki Anton Turunen (born 9 December 1945) is a Finnish author who lives in Joensuu.  He was born in Pielisjärvi, North Karelia, and grew up with his six sisters in a farming family. In 1964 he got a job as a journalist at Karjalan Maa newspaper in Joensuu. He kept this job until 1974, in the last year, as editor.  Turunen's writing deals with Finland in the time in which he grew up, before urbanisation, industrialisation, and tenant farmers. He often describes characters who are a little unusual. Many of his books have been filmed. Bibliography Simpauttaja (1973; J. H.
