Opinions In April 2009, The Guardian withdrew one of Jenkins' articles from its website after African National Congress leader and South African president-elect Jacob Zuma sued the paper for defamation. The Guardian issued an apology, and settled the libel case for an undisclosed sum.In February 2010, Jenkins argued in a Guardian article that British control over the Falkland Islands was an "expensive legacy of empire" and should be handed over to the Argentinian government. He argued that they could be leased back under the supervision of the United Nations and that the 2,500 or so Falkland Islanders should not have "an unqualified veto on British government policy".In a piece in The Guardian in June 2010 he wrote that the government should "cut [defence], all £45 billion of it. ... With the end of the Cold War in the 1990s that threat [of global communism] vanished." In August 2016 he wrote in The Guardian in support of NATO membership, saying: "It is a real deterrent, and its plausibility rests on the assurance of collective response".Jenkins voted for the UK to Remain within the European Union in the 2016 United Kingdom European Union membership referendum, arguing in The Guardian that leaving would provide Germany with dominance over the remainder of the union: "It would leave Germany effectively alone at the head of Europe, alternately hesitant and bullying".Jenkins wrote in The Guardian that Rishi Sunak's aids as Prime Minister were "young, sneakered, tieless image-makers, and fiercely loyal to him." They were "special advisers, thinktanks and lobby groups isolated from the world outside." Books Jenkins has written several books on the politics, history and architecture of England, including England's Thousand Best Churches and England's Thousand Best Houses. In his 2011 book A Short History of England, he argued that the British Empire "was a remarkable institution that dismantled itself in good order".In 2022, Jenkins' book,The Celts: A Sceptical History, stoked some controversy on account of Jenkins incredulous view of the Celts as a distinct cultural entity. The release of the work was met with a number of hostile reviews, with critics of the book citing factual errors in the work as well as of the misrepresentation of some sources, however, other reviews were more supportive of Jenkins.
