Borys Antonenko-Davydovych (Ukrainian: Борис Антоненко-Давидович), born Borys Davydov (Ukrainian: Борис Давидов) was a Ukrainian writer, translator and linguist. During the Great Purge he was sentenced to the death penalty, which was later replaced with ten years jail in a gulag. Antonenko-Davydovych wrote a number of prose books; he had been translating from German and Russian. One of the most famous of his works is "How do we speak" (Як ми говоримо) in which typical mistakes of Ukrainian speakers made under the influence of Russian language are considered.
