He is best known as the first commander of 1 Reconnaissance Commando, South Africa's first special-forces unit.

Military career Breytenbach attended the Army Gymnasium in 1950, and was awarded the Sword of Peace in 1953 and joined the Royal Navy Fleet Air Arm after serving in the Armoured Corps and saw service in the Suez Crisis in 1956. He rejoined the South African Defence Force in 1961 and soon after completed one of 1 Parachute Battalion's courses. Fritz Loots commissioned him to organise 1 Reconnaissance Commando in 1971. In 1975 Breytenbach led Operation Savannah, the SADF's covert intervention in the Angolan Civil War.  The remnants of this group became the elite 32 Battalion, or "Buffalo Battalion". He attended Staff College in 1977 and was promoted to colonel.  In 1978, led the SADF air assault on Cassinga, and has continued to the present day to contest opposing versions of the event in the press.He became senior staff officer for operations at Northern Transvaal Command and commanded 44 Parachute Brigade from 24 September 1980 to 31 December 1982. He founded the SADF Guerilla school, which he commanded until his retirement.Breytenbach retired from the military in 1987, and has written a number of books since then. He is the brother of South African poet and writer Breyten Breytenbach and of war correspondent/photographer Cloete Breytenbach. During the 1980s, Breyten and Jan Breytenbach held strongly opposing political viewpoints, so with his brother opting for a more left-wing approach, this influential family effectively covered the political spectrum.
