Georg Muschner (October 25, 1875 – September 17, 1915) also known by the pseudonym Muschner-Niedenführ) was a German playwright, poet, author and editor, active at the beginning of the 20th century. Born in then Prussian Reichenbach, he moved to Munich around 1904. In addition to his substantial writings for artistic periodicals, he also edited important magazines, bringing himself into creative contact with influential writers of the time, including Erich Mühsam, Richard Dehmel (1903), Friedrich Lienhard, Hans Böttcher, (aka Joachim Ringelnatz), Munich playwright Frank Wedekind and many others. In 1910, along with Theodore Etzel, he founded Die Lese, a literary magazine published yearly in Munich, which purported to bring the reader the best that German literature had to offer each year. For a time, he was sole editor at Die Lese. Muschner was also a lieutenant in the Prussian Army. When he was called up to active service during the First World War, Etzel took over editing responsibilities. Muschner fell in battle in Galicia on the eastern front, on September 17, 1915. He never married, but had a ten-year relationship with German-Jewish writer Clara Hepner while living in Munich, and published her works in Die Lese. After his death, she furthered the posthumous publication of Muschner's works.
