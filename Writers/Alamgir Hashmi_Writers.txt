Alamgir Hashmi (Urdu: عالمگیر ہاشمی), also known as Aurangzeb Alamgir Hashmi (born 15 November 1951), is an English poet of Pakistani origin. Considered avant-garde, his early and later works were published to considerable critical acclaim and popularity.He was a practicing transnational humanist and educator in North American, European and Asian universities. He argued for a "comparative" aesthetic to foster humane cultural norms. He showed and advocated new paths of reading the classical and modern texts and emphasized the sublime nature, position and pleasures of language arts to be shared, rejecting their reduction to social or professional utilities. He produced many books of seminal literary and critical importance as well as series of lectures and essays (such as "Modern Letters") in the general press.
