Aftermath Moraes's heritage house at Bencleamvaddo, Cuncolim collapsed on 17 July 2020 due to continuous rains. It was in a run-down condition for many years and  worsened with time. The ceiling of the house were crumbled during monsoons in 2019, with the remainder of the house falling apart.The distant relatives of Moraes were in the process of claiming the ownership of the property to sell it. However the locals of Cuncolim had made an appeal to the Cuncolim Municipal Council prior to the crumbling to acquire the land and the said heritage house to build a childrens' park in Moraes's name.The locals then questioned the authorities as to why the state administration and local government did not take any initiative in preserving Moraes's home as a historical heritage site. == References ==
