Lee Guem-yi (Korean: 이금이; born January 4, 1962) is an author of children's and young adult literature who is recognized to have pioneered and further expanded the genre of children's and young adult fiction in Korea.

In the early days of her career, she mainly wrote children's stories set in rural areas including Keundori in Bamtee Village, leading her to earn the nickname “the writer of agricultural villages.” Lee has aimed to address the dark underbelly of the developing Korean society and issues involving minorities including women and the handicapped.

Moreover, through historical novels Can’t I Go Instead? and The Picture Bride, she has provided in-depth insight into modern and contemporary Korean history and expanded the limits and beyond of young adult fiction.
