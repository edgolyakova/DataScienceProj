Based on the field study of several dozen companies, such as W. L. Gore, USAA, Harley Davidson, Sun Hydraulics, Richards Group, IDEO, Chaparral Steel, FAVI, and SOL, it described the role of corporate—liberating—leaders to build organizational environment based on freedom and responsibility. The revised and expanded edition has been published in 2016. Book’s editions have also appeared in Sweden, Hungary, Czech Republic, Netherlands, India, Israel, China, Romania, Italy, Spain, and South Korea and is forthcoming in Japan.
