Rakitic was a meditative lyric poet with a distinct feeling for history, culture and traditional values. His lyrically-intimist, elegiac, reflexive and religious poetry tries to offer answers to eternal issues of life and death, to the position of an individual and historic, collective sufferings. Rakitić's poetic discourse is outstandingly metaphysical, noble and dominantly neosymbolistic. Thematically, by forms and motives found in them, his poems correspond to the old religious service literature.

In 1990, he took part in founding the "Serbian Renewal Movement" (SPO), the largest opposition party at that time, led by Vuk Drašković. He was the President of Serbian Renewal Movement parliamentary fraction in the Serbian Parliament during the first pluralist National Assembly (1991–1992), also the leader of the parliamentary fraction (1993–1994) of DEPOS - "Democratic Movement of Serbia" (a large union of major opposition parties and numerous individuals not belonging to any of the political parties).

In 2013 he was posthumously awarded the literature award "Jelena Balšić", established by the 'Metropolitanate of Montenegro and the Littoral', and is awarded every two years.
