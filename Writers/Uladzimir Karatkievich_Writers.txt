One of the writer's maternal relatives, according to family legend - Thomas Hrynkevich, took part in the uprising of 1863. The rebels under his command were defeated, and he himself was shot in Rahačow.

Many of the stories of his grandfather became a source for future works of Vladimir.Vladimir learned to read very early, at the age of three and a half.
