Notable works 'Snow storm', with Destiny Deacon. In 2007, Sebastian Smee when reviewing the National Indigenous Art Triennial wrote of this piece:...there is one work in it I couldn't get out of my mind...Two plinths support glass boxes. Inside the boxes are golliwogs suspended in, and mostly obscured by, a sea of white polystyrene balls. It's a simple work, but it's scathing. On the most general level it's about framing: about how a dominant culture frames the people it has subordinated...thus modern Australia convinces itself that it is protecting its indigenous inhabitants, but just as often it suffocates them, even while maintaining a racist, sentimental image of them.Commissioned centrepiece video (title unknown) for Moomba: What's in a name? (Melbourne Town Hall, 2008). This video explores the ambiguity of the word Moomba. Fraser interviews some of Aboriginal leader Bill Onus' then surviving family members and linguists with knowledge of Indigenous languages. Although the video asks the question, it does not provide and answer.
