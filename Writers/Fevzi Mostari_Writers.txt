Fevzi Mostari (also spelled Fawzi or Fowzi; c. 1675–1747) was a Bosnian writer, who authored the Persian work Bulbulistan ("A Place of Nightingales"; also spelled Bolbolestān) in 1739. Written in imitation of the Golestan of Saadi Shirazi (died 1291/2), it is the only extant prose work in Persian by a writer of Bosnian origin. It is viewed as an important artifact of the Bosnian literary tradition. He was born in Blagaj, near Mostar. Sources Algar, Hamid (1994). "PERSIAN LITERATURE IN BOSNIA-HERZEGOVINA".
