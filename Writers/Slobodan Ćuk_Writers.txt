Slobodan Ćuk (Serbo-Croatian pronunciation: [tʃuk]) is a Serbian author, inventor, business owner, electrical engineer, and professor of electrical engineering at the California Institute of Technology (Caltech).  The Ćuk switched-mode DC-to-DC voltage converter is named after him. Biography For over 20 years, he was a full-time Professor of Electrical Engineering at the California Institute of Technology until January 1, 2000.In 1979, Slobodan founded TESLAco, located in Laguna Niguel, California.  It had a charter to apply basic research results developed at Caltech for practical commercial and military designs.Over 30 patents have Ćuk's name on them. Personal life Slobodan's parents are Milojko and Julijana Ćuk.  He speaks American English and Serbian. On February 29, 1972, Slobodan immigrated from Belgrade, Yugoslavia to the United States and was sponsored by NASA.Slobodan received a Dipl.Ing. from University of Belgrade in 1970, a M.S. in Electrical Engineering from Santa Clara University in 1974, and a Ph.D. in Power Electronics from the California Institute of Technology (Caltech) in 1977.
