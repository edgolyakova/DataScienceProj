He is very passionate on the subjects of bereavement support, suicide prevention and postvention, mental health reform, and positive ageing to name a few. He has said "I believe there is no point in developing great policies and strategies if we don't implement them. One death by suicide is one too many. Yet every year hundreds of our citizens die by suicide and many more attempt suicide. If you take that number and consider the ripples of heartbreak that extend through families, friends, work colleagues, club mates and local communities, you get some idea of the ocean of hurt and pain that surrounds us."Kenneally is married to Linda Finnegan, a Clinical Psychologist and Psychotherapist.
