Whaling
Later in his life, Risting became interested in whaling and began to write about the history and statistics of modern whaling.

Since 1903 he had compiled annual reviews, and in June 1913 he joined the staff of the newly started periodical "Norsk Hvalfangst-Tidende" (The Norwegian Whaling Gazette) for which he later (1922–1935) became the editor. In 1930 Risting created the International Whaling Statistics and in the first numbers of the periodical he collected from the whole world whaling statistics back to 1868.From 1918 to the end of his life, Risting was secretary of the Norsk Hvalfangerforening (the Whaling Association of Norway).
