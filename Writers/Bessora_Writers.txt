Biography Because of her numerous stays abroad (Belgium, Switzerland, Austria, France, the United States, Gabon) and her varied origins (Gabon, Switzerland, France, Germany, Poland), Bessora's writing possesses a free, demanding, and unclassifiable character.Having first dreamed of being a stewardess, Bessora later attended the HEC Lausanne, and then the Paris Dauphine University. After obtaining a degree in management and a master's degree in applied economics, she worked in finance before changing course. Following a journey in South Africa, she studied anthropology in Paris, before publishing her first novel in 1999. She obtained a doctorate in anthropology in 2002, and continued to write novels. She has been compared to Raymond Queneau, and Nathalie Sarraute.She was awarded the Fénéon Prize in 2001 for her novel Ink Stains, and the Grand prix littéraire d'Afrique noire in 2007 for her novel Pick Me Pretty Sirs...
