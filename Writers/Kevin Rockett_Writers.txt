ISBN 1-84682-019-7 Recognition The Irish Times wrote in 1996 of Rockett's early work Cinema and Ireland (1987), offering that it "remains the Bible of Irish film studies." Filmmaker Bob Quinn wrote of Irish Filmography: Fiction Films 1896 – 1996 (1996), stating [the book is] "an extraordinary opus ... Rockett is an excellent and painstaking scholar. Never before has anybody attempted to document in one volume every film ever made in or about Ireland. ... The amount of detail he has unearthed is no less than stupendous. ... The nearest literary analogy I can think of is Dineen's Irish Dictionary", Jeff Brownrigg of Australia's National Film and Sound Archive wrote that the book is "an indispensable tool for the researcher." and that it "provides a valuable source of information about a large group of international narrative feature films gathered together under the head of their general association with Ireland."  He comments on the book's nearly two thousand entries and makes note of its comprehensive nature, concluding that it "is clearly an essential reference for libraries and will be sought by film buffs."Lir Mac Cárthaigh of Film Ireland wrote that Neil Jordan: exploring boundaries (2003) "provides a convenient starting-point for anyone intending to write about Jordan's work, the history of Irish film, or cinematic representations."John Kelleher, former Director of the Irish Film Classification Office, referred to Rockett's book Irish Film Censorship (2004) as the key text on the subject. It was described as "magisterial," (Hugh Linehan, Irish Times) "monumental," (RTÉ Radio 1) "meticulous," (Luke Gibbons, Irish Times) and "fascinating" (Kim Bielenberg, Irish Independent).In 2001, Rockett received the Irish Film Institute Award for Contribution to Irish Film. == References ==
