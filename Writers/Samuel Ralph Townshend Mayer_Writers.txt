Leigh Hunt legacy
In 1847 correspondence, the campaigning journalist and poet Leigh Hunt (died 1859) mentioned G. J. De Wilde of the Nottingham Mercury, and Dalby, as valued supporters. Mayer organized Hunt's memorial service. He also took up Samuel Carter Hall's suggestion of a memorial to Hunt, in Kensal Green Cemetery, set up in 1869. He was instrumental, with Robert Browning and Dalby, in dedicating an abbey niche to Hunt.
Thornton Leigh Hunt, Hunt's son, gave the Leigh Hunt papers to Mayer shortly before his 1873 death. Mayer then added to the published correspondence of Leigh Hunt, in periodicals, with letters involving Benjamin Robert Haydon, Charles Ollier, Thomas Southwood Smith and Lord Brougham.
