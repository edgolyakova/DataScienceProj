She graduated from Gyeonggi Girls' High School and Sookmyung Women's University. She had her childhood during the Korean War and began reading books as a way of overcoming harsh realities.

Writing Poems of Love and Moderation She is called "The Poet of Love and Moderation". The nickname derives from the beauty of form achieved through the implications of love and meaning, her works' main subject. The Oriental love song-style lyric poetry that uses han as the main emotion and delicately depicts separation and longing of the beloved one is the biggest feature of her poetry. Love in her poetry is not limited to erotic love between men and women, but is manifested in various forms, including parental and filial love and love for religious absolutes. Her poem regards "love" as the greatest value and reveals the multifaceted meaning of "love". Huh's "love" extends beyond the realm of emotion and into reality. Bundan – Sangsacho (분단 – 상사초 Division – Herb of Longing) sings of the sorrow of the national division by comparing it to Sangsacho whose flowers and leaves cannot meet. Another feature of her poetry, "moderation", is expressed as a form of condensed beauty. The poet herself tried to make it contain the most meaning in as little language as possible. She described the value of acquiring rhythm, implications, polysemy, symbolism through temperance of language in the eight-line Muju (무제 Untitled·I). In Jasu (자수 Embroidery, the process of overcoming heartache and sorrow of losing a loved one by embroidering is described with restrained emotions and the poetic diction "riverside" expresses in a pithy way the state of equilibrium that was finally reached.Diverse Religiosity Religiousness in her poems is not confined to a specific religion, but shows various facets such as Buddhism, Christianity, and pantheism. Her poetry Gwaneumbosallim (관음보살님 Avalokitesvara Bodhisattva) is tinged with Buddhism, using incense and kindles. Im (임 Thee) presents the pantheistic worldview in which all is God and Chakan moksu (착한 목수 Good Carpenter) eulogizes Jesus' sacrifice and love. This attitude goes beyond the religious meaning and extends to a saga of men who put the broken selves at the center of the world in her poetry collection Makdalla maria (막달라 마리아 Mary Magdalene) (2017). Multifaceted religiousness in her poems is seen to be attributable to a flexible attitude toward life and multilateral perspectives.
