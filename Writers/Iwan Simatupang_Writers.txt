His first writings were published in Siasat and Mimbar Indonesia (Indonesian Pulpit). In 1963, he won second prize from Sastra (Literature) magazine for his essay "Kebebasan Pengarang dan Masalah Tanah Air" (Writers' Freedom and the Problems of the Motherland). Most of his early works were short stories, poems and plays.
He wrote his first novel, Ziarah (The Pilgrim) in a month in 1960; the novel was published in Indonesia in 1969, and was awarded the first ASEAN Literary Award for the Novel in Bangkok in 1977.
