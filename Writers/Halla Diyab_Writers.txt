Campaign against extremism
In 2005 Diyab was commissioned to write her first television series, Beautiful Maidens. The title was derived from the 72 beautiful virgins who are said to meet martyrs in heaven. The series was about the victims and perpetrators of a suicide bombing in Saudi Arabia. It aired during Ramadan and generated high viewing figures and mass media interest.
She also wrote a 30-episode television drama; Ma Malakat Aymanukum, or Your Rightful Disposal, which was also broadcast during Ramadan. The title is from a passage in the Koran which talks of the enslavement of women. This series breaks of taboos on a range of contentious topics such as homosexuality, virginity, extremism, sexual and physical abuse, the burqa and the French ban on face covering. The show follows a woman who moves to France from the Middle East and what her life is like without the burka.
Ma Malakat Aymanukum also received high viewing figures.

Criticism
After Beautiful Maidens aired Diyab became a target for clerics and scholars who accused her of insulting Islam. Before the release of Ma Malakat Aymanukum unsuccessful attempts were made to persuade the Syrian government to ban her work.
Diyab has been accused of atheism and her private life was investigated by religious leaders. Sheikh Said Ramadan al-Bouti claimed that God was withholding rain as a punishment to the nation for her work.
She received further opposition during an interview on London-based Arabic TV channel Alhiwar in October 2010.
In response, she stated, "I feel marginalized and I am always under fire in the Middle East media because of my liberal views and because I strive to break the boundaries. Religious scholars want to silence the voice of women and they play the role of politicians in the Middle East."

Controversy over the Burka
She has been outspoken about the burka. In addition to writing Ma Malakat Aymanukum, she has expressed personal views on the clothing item.
She believes Arabic women are being oppressed by men claiming to be motivated by religion. She sees the burka as a barrier to women achieving the equality they deserve.

Meetings with Gaddafi
Diyab was approached twice by former Libyan leader Muammar Gaddafi over media projects. In 2007 they discussed a film he wanted made about the Italian colonisation of Libya. The film was to be called "Dhulm: Years of Torment".
She described Gaddafi as "ruthless and intimidating". After agreeing to write the film and completing the script, the film was dropped due to a change in the diplomatic situation with Italy.
In 2010 she was asked to produce a documentary on the late leader's life, however she declined the project claiming that it would "affect [her] credibility".

Television credentials
Fitnah
As of 2012 Dr Diyab was working on Fitnah, a 30- part reality TV series about a group of young British and Middle Eastern Muslims who confront, challenge and hopefully deter their descent into radical fundamentalism and religious extremism.
Fitnah's mission is to inspire Muslim youths through a series of confrontations with extreme views of Islam, to help them reach a balanced view of Islam.
The show brings together some of Britain's and the Middle East's most extreme youths to see if they can be changed and persuaded by 8 mentors.
The series will attempt to uncover whether their attitudes are due to personal and family circumstance, society or religious politics and Islam itself. It also examines how mentors use their real-life expertise to impact their charges.
