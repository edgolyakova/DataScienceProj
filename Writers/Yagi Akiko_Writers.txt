Yagi Akiko (1895–1983) was an anarchist writer and activist. She wrote for anarchist women's arts journals Fujin Sensen (The Women's Front) and Nyonin Geijutsu (Women's Arts) on topics including bolshevism, the commercial commodification of women, and the imperial founding of Manchukuo, a puppet state that she described as a slave, having traded one imperial ruler for another. Her travelogue "Letters from a Trip to Kyushu", written with Fumiko Hayashi, tells of their drinking and meeting men, as two modern women outré for the time period.
