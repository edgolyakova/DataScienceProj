Born in Mulhouse, Lion studied history and philosophy in Strasbourg, Munich and Heidelberg, got to know André Gide during a stay in Paris and worked as a journalist during the First World War, among others for the Neuen Merkur. Since 1917 he became friends with Thomas Mann, later also with Alfred Döblin.
