Political career A member of the Labor Party, Moatti was placed fifteenth on the joint list of Labor, Meretz and Gesher for the 2020 Knesset elections, but the alliance won only seven seats. Prior to the 2021 elections she was placed third on the Labor Party list, and was elected to the Knesset as the party won seven seats. During the constructive vote of no confidence to remove the Netanyahu government and install the Bennett-Lapid "change" coalition, Moatti's vote was crucial. She was unable to stand as a result of a spinal infection and had to be rushed back from hospital on a stretcher to cast her vote for the new government, which was ultimately installed by a 60–59 vote. For the 2022 elections Moatti was placed sixth on the Labor list, but lost her seat as the party won only four seats. References External links Emilie Moatti on the Knesset website
