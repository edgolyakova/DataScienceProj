Diplomatic career
With the carnation revolution, Cutileiro was invited by Mário Soares to enter the diplomatic service, having started by being a cultural attaché of the Portuguese embassy in London.From 1974 to 1994 Cutileiro worked for the Portuguese Foreign Service and from 1977 to 1980 was the first permanent Portuguese representative to the Council of Europe. He served as the Portuguese ambassador to Mozambique (1980-1983) and to South Africa (1989-1991), at the time of the release of Nelson Mandela from prison. Cutileiro also led the Portuguese Delegation to the OSCE Conference on Disarmament in Stockholm from 1984 to 1986.In 1988 he negotiated the accession of Portugal to the Western European Union. In 1992, as coordinator of the European Community's Conference on Yugoslavia, he presided over talks on future constitutional arrangements for Bosnia and Herzegovina.  
Several plans were proposed before and during the Bosnian War by the European Community and the United Nations. Cutileiro was co-author of the Carrington–Cutileiro plan, sometimes known as the Lisbon Agreement, in February 1992, an attempt to prevent Bosnia-Herzegovina sliding into war.From 1994 to 1999 he was Secretary-General of the Western European Union, at that time the only European defense organization. In 1999, it was agreed that the holder of the newly created post of High Representative for the Common Foreign and Security Policy of the European Union should also be the Secretary-General of the WEU. Thus, Cutileiro was the last independent general secretary of this institution and was succeeded by Javier Solana.
From 2001 to 2003 he served as a Special Envoy of the UN Commissioner for Human Rights in Bosnia-Herzegovina and Serbia.
He served as adviser for the Portuguese presidency of the EU Council and, in 2005, as special political advisor to José Manuel Durão Barroso as president of the European Commission.

Writing career
As a writer, Cutileiro is best known for a fictionalized history written under the pseudonym A. B. Kotter.  Kotter is supposedly an elitist expatriate English aristocrat living in Colares with his pro-fascist mother.  The stories describe their experiences living in post-revolutionary Portugal.  These chronicles were serialized in the British newspaper The Independent between 1993 and 1998 and were collected into the book Bilhetes de Colares in 2004.Cutileiro wrote essays, poetry books and other works of an anthropological nature, the most recent publication being the “Inventário: Desabafos e Divagações de Um Sético”.He also wrote obituaries for the Expresso, including those for Mário Soares, Maria de Jesus and Fidel Castro. In the last years he also held an international relations column entitled 'The World of Others'.
