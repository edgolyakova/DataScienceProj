During these four years, Kihoro's situation was contrasted with that of Terri Schiavo, with Kihoro's husband Wanyiri Kihoro and the rest of her family unanimous in believing she should continue to be on life support at Nairobi's Kenyatta National Hospital. At the time of her death, she was survived by her husband, and four children: Wangui, Pambana, Amandla and Wairimu.On her death, The Guardian commented that there were "few African women as well known as Wanjiru Kihoro". Wangui wa Goro wrote in Pambazuka News: "[S]he was a leader, activist for democracy, freedom, human rights, equality and justice and always stood on the side of the oppressed, particularly women and the poor. She worked tirelessly and with courage, using her razor-sharp intellect to focus thousands, of the task at hand in creative ways which brought her knowledge and everyday life together in very practical ways."
