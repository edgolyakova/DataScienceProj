Wealth Dynamics
Hamilton developed the Wealth Dynamics profiling system in 2003. This system has since been used by over 250,000 entrepreneurs around the world and has been internationally acknowledged as a valuable tool for entrepreneurs.The system is a psychometric test based on the work of Carl Jung, and linking his work to the I Ching, which Jung studied and which influenced and relates to his published work Psychological Types published in 1921.  Jung wrote the foreword to the first published translation, by Richard Wilhelm, of the I Ching. The system links back to the five Chinese elements, and the Chinese concepts of flow created from the alternating interlink of opposites.
The Wealth Dynamics system divides all success strategies into eight paths, detailed in Hamilton's book Your Life, Your Legacy: An Entrepreneur Guide to Finding Your Flow.In 2010, the Wealth Dynamics system was supplemented with the Wealth Spectrum levels, which divides each profile into nine levels. It was also modified into the Talent Dynamics system for use in corporations. It is now being used in various organisations from the UK National Health Service (NHS) to General Mills.
In 2010, 30 leading entrepreneurs published a book on their use of Wealth Dynamics in their businesses, titled The Wealth Garden, Catching Butterflies Without a Net.Additional books advocating the "Wealth Dynamics" model include John Williams' Screw Work Let's Play, Bob Urichuck's Disciplined for Life, and Penny & Thomas Power's A Friend in Every City.
