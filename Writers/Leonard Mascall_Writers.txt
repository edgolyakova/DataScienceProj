Leonard Mascall (died 1589) was an English author and translator.

Life
His family was from Plumstead, Kent, and he became clerk of the kitchen in the household of Matthew Parker, archbishop of Canterbury.Mascall died at Farnham Royal, Buckinghamshire, and was buried there on 10 May 1589. 
The claims that he introduced carp and the pippin apple to England were doubted: carp were introduced earlier, and the Maschall who introduced the pippin at Plumstead (which may have been a printing error), as Thomas Fuller says, is more plausibly an ancestor.
