Dawn Kurtagich (born c.â€‰1987) is a psychological horror and young adult fiction author. She lives in Wales though she grew up in a number of places around the world, including mostly within Africa. Her mother was single and a globe trotter and missionary. Kurtagich was born in the late 1980s. In 2011 she was ill with liver failure recovering after a transplant, and she used that and her experience of someone she knew who had Dissociative Identity Disorder to write her first novel. That novel is described as Young Adult fiction but reviewers firmly place it as something for over fifteens. A companion novella was produced to go with her first novel.
