She is active in Guyanese public life as the President of the Guyanese Indian Heritage Association (GIHA).In November 2009, Shah was chosen one of The 500 Most Influential Muslims as a novelist, despite criticism for race baiting in Guyana's 2015 election.The GIHA aims to promote Indo-Guyanese culture. The organization competes with the Indian Arrival Committee, which is aligned with the People's Progressive Party.
