According to the German orientalist Carl Brockelmann, al-Battiwi was the commanding general of the Marinid sultan of Morocco, Abu al-Hasan Ali ibn Othman.His work was commented upon in the 15th century by Abd al-Rahman al-Jadiri, the muwaqqit (time-keeper) at the Qarawiyyin Mosque, and the mathematician Al-Qalasadi. He was a native of the Rif region of Morocco.
