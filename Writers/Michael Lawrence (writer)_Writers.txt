His work most widely held in WorldCat libraries is the 2003 novel A Crack in the Line, first in a trilogy called The Aldous Lexicon, or Withern Rise in the United States. Much of the Jiggy McCue series of sixteen books is widely held in participating libraries. His only known website active in 2022 is that of the graphics artist McLaw. Biography Michael Lawrence was born in Huntingdonshire, England. His family moved to Sudbury, Middlesex when he was four. In his teens he attended Ealing School of Art before working in London as a graphic designer and photographer. Later, Lawrence became an art and antiques dealer, but when he sold a novel (When the Snow Falls, published in 1995), he decided to concentrate on writing for young people. When the Snow Falls was later rewritten and recast for older readers as A Crack in the Line, the first novel in The Withern Rise Trilogy. He also co-authored The Poppykettle Papers with Robert Ingpen, and his book Young Dracula and Young Monsters was the basis for the CBBC television series Young Dracula.
