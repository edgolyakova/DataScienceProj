al-Gharbi Amran served as the deputy mayor of Sanaa for several years in the latter half of the 2010s. His first novel Mushaf Ahmar (Red Book) was published from Beirut in January 2010. The novel deals with vexing social problems like extremism and the oppression of women in Yemeni society. Two months after the publication of the book, Amran was relieved of his duties as deputy mayor. Amran claimed that this was due to the controversial content of his novel, although this was denied by the authorities.

This too was denied by Yemen's Book Authority.al-Gharbi Amran heads a Yemeni literary club called el-Maqah.
