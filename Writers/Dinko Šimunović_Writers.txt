Dinko Šimunović (1 September 1873 – 3 August 1933) was a Croatian writer. Dinko Šimunović was born in Knin. He spent almost two decades as a teacher in villages of the Zagora, the hinterland of Dalmatia. He retired in 1927 and moved to Zagreb in 1929, where he died in 1933. Šimunović wrote many stories and two novels, all dealing with people from his native region. His contemporaries described his works as championing a patriarchal, hierarchical, black-and-white world, an impression further reinforced by author's personal distaste towards the modern, urban way of living.
