Julian Evans is an Australian writer and presenter.
In 1990 he left his office job to become a writer and spent six months travelling among the islands of the south Pacific Ocean. In 1992 he published Transit of Venus: Travels in the Pacific. This launched him on a career as a writer of books, travel articles, essays, and radio and television documentaries on literary subjects. He is also a translator and a reviewer for a number of newspapers and magazines, including the Guardian, Daily Telegraph, Times Literary Supplement and Prospect. His most recent full-length book was Semi-Invisible Man: the Life of Norman Lewis (2008), which was reviewed favourably; Evans wrote about writer and adventurer Norman Lewis after he described Evans's first book, Transit of Venus, as "far and away the best book about the Pacific of our times."
