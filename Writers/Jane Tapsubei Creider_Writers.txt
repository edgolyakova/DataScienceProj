Two Lives tells of her upbringing as a member of the Nandi tribe, being educated by Christian missionaries, going to live in North America, before eventually marrying a Canadian professor: "The autobiography articulates two main cultural models of identity: the traditional Nandi identity, which is constituted by the spirit world of the ancestors and the extended family, and the autonomous individual, which is a European import into African culture. ... In creating the story of her life, Creider almost inadvertently shows how the contacts between two sometimes incommensurable models of identity have produced out of both modern and traditional materials the nomadic trickster/ethnographer she has become."Creider's writing has been included in collections such as Daughters of Africa (1992), edited by Margaret Busby, and Fiery Spirits (1995), edited by Ayanna Black.
