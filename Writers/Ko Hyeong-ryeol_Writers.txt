Ko Hyeong-ryeol (The romanization preferred by the author according to LTI Korea) born 1954 is a modern Korean poet.

Life
Ko Hyeong-ryeol was born in the town of Haenam at the southern tip of Korean Peninsula and grew up in Sokcho, Gangwon-do. After high school, Go passed an exam to become a government employee and worked as a clerk in his township. He made his literary debut in 1979 with "Zhuangzi" which was published in Contemporary Literature.

Work
Ko is a poet of “peculiar” voice. Calm even as it discusses the history of Korean national division or the author's wish for Korean reunification, his poetic language carries the halting tone of a soliloquy muttered or a conversation initiated with difficulty. Though never exertive, Ko's poetry exudes the strength of compassion and warmth grounded in the poet's own perspective toward the world, which is not that of a distant observer but rather that of a close neighbor who meditates on things as though they are an immediate part of his life. As Ko has aged his work  has become even more humble and pure in tone. Ko as often describes the world as full of sorrow and suffering, but his poetry also expresses life with compassion and understanding.
