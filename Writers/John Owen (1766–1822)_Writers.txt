John Owen (1766–1822) was an English Anglican priest, a secretary on its foundation of the British and Foreign Bible Society.

Life
The son of Richard Owen, a jeweller of Old Street, London, he entered St Paul's School on 18 October 1777. He went on, in 1784, as Sykes exhibitioner, to Magdalene College, Cambridge, where he was admitted as sizar. He migrated to Corpus Christi College, Cambridge, and was admitted a scholar there later in 1784, graduated B.A. in 1788, became a Fellow in 1789, and proceeded M.A. in 1791.In the spring of 1791 Owen went on the continent of Europe, at first as tutor to a young gentleman. In September 1792 he left Geneva for the south of France, and arrived in Lyon to find it in the hands of revolutionaries. He returned to Switzerland, and so to England, in 1793.Shortly after his return Owen was ordained. At the end of 1795 he was presented by Beilby Porteus, bishop of London, to the curacy of Fulham, Middlesex, where he resided for seventeen and a half years. Porteus had presented him in 1808 to the rectory of Paglesham, Essex; and when, in 1813, John Randolph, Porteus's successor, insisted that Owen resided there, he resigned the Fulham curacy. He later became minister of Park Chapel, Chelsea.

British and Foreign Bible Society
Owen's connection with the British and Foreign Bible Society (BFBS) is his main claim to fame. From 23 April 1804—a few weeks after its foundation—until his death he was its principal secretary, an unpaid position.In August 1818 Owen went abroad, to assist with the establishment of a branch bible society in Paris, and to inspect the progress of the Turkish New Testament, then in course of preparation for the society by Jean-Daniel Kieffer. He visited J. F. Oberlin and the branches established at Zurich, St. Gall, Constance, and other Swiss towns. He returned to England in December.

Death
Owen died at Ramsgate on 26 September 1822, and was buried at Fulham.

Owen published some letters which he had addressed to William Belsham, as Travels into Different Parts of Europe, in the years 1791 and 1792, with familiar Remarks on Places, Men, and Manners, London, 1796, 2 vols. On 11 March and 5 August 1794 Owen preached assize sermons in Great St Mary's. These were published at Cambridge in 1794.
