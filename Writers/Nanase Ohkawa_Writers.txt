Nanase Ohkawa (大川 七瀬, Ōkawa Nanase, born May 2, 1967) is a member of the all-female manga-creating team CLAMP. She is the director of the team and is primarily responsible for writing the stories and scripts for CLAMP's various works.
As part of CLAMP's 15th Anniversary, each of the four members changed their names reportedly because they wanted to try out the new monikers.  Ohkawa changed her name to Ageha Ohkawa (大川 緋芭, Ōkawa Ageha) in 2004.  Ohkawa still used her previous name for some of the scripts she wrote for animated series.
Ohkawa announced in her blog that from March 1, 2008, she should be addressed as Nanase Ohkawa again.
