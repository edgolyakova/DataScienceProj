Raif Khoury (c. 1913–1967) was a Lebanese writer, poet, essayist, novelist and playwright who was born in Nabay, Lebanon, then part of the Ottoman Empire towards the beginning of the twentieth century. He went to school in the neighboring town of Brummana to Broummana High School, where he started writing poetry at a very early age. He joined the American University of Beirut as an Arabic literature and history major and graduated with a BA in 1932. Even before he graduated, he started writing in literary magazines and papers such as Al Barq, Al Adib and Al Adab which were issued in Beirut at the time. During his lifetime, Khoury wrote more than 20 books and numerous articles in many of the literary magazines and journals as well as daily newspapers of his time.
