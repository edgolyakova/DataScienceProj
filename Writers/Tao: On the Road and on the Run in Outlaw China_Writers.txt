Reception
Rory MacLean writing in The Guardian said: "Tao doesn't begin well" and "For me, these first pages read like a teenage romantic novel". However he also says: "As their exhilarating, eight-month journey grows ever more dangerous, Aya writes with increasing clarity".Colin Thubron writing for The Times said, "This, in its outlandish way, is a unique memoir. At once naive, tough, stark and sentimental, Tao recounts an eight-month rite of passage in which the reader sees, through its authorâ€™s still-innocent eyes, a Japanese art student entering an adolescent dream of love on the road".The organisation behind World Book Day published a list of "Most Worth Talking about Books" to launch its new Spread the Word website with Tao as one of the books in the list.
