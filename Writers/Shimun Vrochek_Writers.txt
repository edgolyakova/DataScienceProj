Shimun Vrochek (Russian: Шимун Врочек), real name Dmitry S. Ovchinnikov (Russian: Дмитрий Овчинников) (born 1 November 1976) is a Russian science fiction author. His work Piter (a novel from the Universe of Metro 2033 book series) has been cited as a case study of the boom in prosumer level participation in Russian fan fiction, using transmedia in ways that echo traditional Soviet methods, yet is completely commodified.

He is best known as the author of Piter, a novel from the Metro 2033 universe. All of his works were originally written in Russian, though some of them have been translated to other languages. Piter has been translated to a number of European languages – such as German, Polish and Spanish.In 2006, Мир Фантастики honored his work as "best national collection." That year, his short story collection Serzhantu Nikto Ne Zvonit won the Golden Caduceus at the Kharkiv International Fiction Festival (nicknamed the Star Bridge festival).
