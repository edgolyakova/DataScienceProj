Inge Krokann (19 August 1893 – 27 September 1962) was a Norwegian writer. His most famous work is I Dovre Sno (1929), an epic story of the Loe family during the Middle Ages. Because his writing was full of local expressions and is so strongly tied to the use of the Oppdal dialect and idiosyncratic Nynorsk, his works are largely inaccessible and difficult to translate. Biography Ingebrikt Krokann was born at Oppdal in Trøndelag, Norway. He was the son of Trond Jonsson Krokann (1858-1936) and Dørdi Olsdatter Lo (1859-1933).

He developed tuberculosis and never fully recovered. He taught at the Nordic folk college in Fredriksberg in Denmark during 1937–1938. Krokann received several travel grants and traveled to many countries in Europe and Africa.He was married in 1921 with Gunvor Widebæk Lund (1899-1991). He died at Gausdal in Oppland, Norway.
