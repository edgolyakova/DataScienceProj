Clyde William Sanger MA (20 November 1928 – 20 January 2022) was an English-Canadian journalist and author. He worked on newspapers in the UK and Africa before becoming the first Africa correspondent for The Guardian newspaper in 1960. He moved to North America in 1965, where he continued to work as a journalist, as well as for various Canadian and international research and development institutes. He wrote extensively on politics, economics, international development, the environment and other subjects throughout his long career. He lived in Ottawa, Ontario, Canada. Early life and education Sanger studied at Twyford School (1938 to 1942) and Shrewsbury School (1942 to 1947), where he was Head of School. He spent 1947 to 1949 doing his National Service on the Suez Canal as a second lieutenant in the 4th Royal Tank Regiment. He then studied at Brasenose College, Oxford University (1949 to 1952). Professional work Sanger spent his early career as a reporter for the Staffordshire Evening Sentinel, the London Evening News and the Daily Mail.  In 1957 he moved to Southern Rhodesia (now Zimbabwe) and became editor of a magazine on politics and economics, The Central African Examiner. In 1959 he joined The Guardian newspaper, becoming their first Africa correspondent in 1960. His work focused mainly on Central, Southern and Eastern Africa, and from 1957 to 1965 he covered news stories of a social, economic, environmental and political nature, getting to know nationalist leaders such as Joshua Nkomo and Ndabaningi Sithole of Zimbabwe, Dr. Hastings (Kumuzu) Banda of Malawi, and Kenneth Kaunda of Zambia.Sanger's words were quoted in the UK House of Commons by James Callaghan, then MP for Cardiff South-East, in relation to the politically-motivated expulsion of John Stonehouse, MP for Wednesbury, from Rhodesia and Nyasaland.  The sometimes dangerous nature of life as a journalist is described in an entertaining memoir by Peter Rand, in an episode involving several Western journalists including Sanger, at the time of the Zanzibar Revolution in 1963.Sanger moved to North America in 1965, and worked as UN correspondent and Canada correspondent for The Guardian, Parliamentary reporter for The Globe and Mail, and Canada correspondent for The Economist; he also contributed regularly to the Gemini News Service.

Archive In 2018 Sanger donated his large archive of notebooks, letters, newspaper cuttings, draft articles and reports to The Guardian News & Media Archive (GNM). Cataloguing was carried out in 2019.

A large proportion of the notebooks are written in Pitman shorthand, which are undergoing a digitised transcription process before they can be made available for research. An online catalogue is already available.Another archival item, in Sanger's handwriting (also containing newspaper cuttings, cartoons and photographs), is a large notebook entitled 'Journal of an Extraordinary Heads of Government Meeting, Lusaka, Zambia, August 1979', but covering many other dates and events from February to September of that year, held by the School of Advanced Study, University of London. Personal and family life Sanger married the journalist and activist Penny Ketchum (1931-2017) in Surrey, in June 1959; they had four sons (Matthew, Richard, Toby and Daniel) and ten grandchildren (Ariel, Maeve, Malcolm, Claire, Louis, Tommy, Alia, Adam, Antoine and Eliza).
