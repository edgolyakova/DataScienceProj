He spent all his secondary school years (1986 to 1993) at Ghana National College, Cape Coast.

There, he pursued a bachelor's degree in chemical engineering and completed in 1999.

Writing
Damoah started writing seriously in 1993 when he was in the sixth form at Ghana National College. He wrote his first creative piece, "A Day in Carthage", in a History class. He has had a number of his short stories published in local Ghanaian newspapers, the Mirror and the Spectator. In 1997, he won the first prize in the Step Magazine National Story Writing Competition with the story "The Written Letter". His writing has appeared in StoryTime ezine, Legon Business Journal, Sentinel Nigeria Magazine and the anthology African Roar (StoryTime Publishing, 2010).
Nana Awere Damoah's writings cannot be classified into a particular genre of writing. According to him, "I just try write and create my own style". His first two books, Excursions in My Mind and Through the Gates of Thought, are mostly autobiographical in nature and he calls them "reflective writing". For his non-fiction writing, he tries to bring a mix of styles â€“ poetry, storytelling and satire. He uses a lot of personal experiences and observations. Tales from Different Tails, his third book, is straightforward fiction; short stories. In that book, he uses local settings and experiments with some traditional Ghanaian by-the-fireside sort of narrative. His last two books, I Speak of Ghana and Sebitically Speaking, he categorizes under travel and historical non-fiction and mostly narratives on Ghana, with a good dose of satire in them as well.
Nana Awere Damoah and his friend, Kofi Akpabli organize quarterly book reading events in various cities in Ghana. This initiative started since 2011.
