Wasyl Ciapiński (Belarusian: Vasil Ciapinski (Васіль Мікалаевіч Цяпінскі-Амельяновіч); Polish: Wasyl Ciapiński, Omelianowicz; Russian: Vasily Tyapinski) (1540s in Vitebsk Voivodeship – c. 1604) was a Belarusian-Lithuanian noble, humanist, educator, writer, publisher and translator from the Grand Duchy of Lithuania known for translating the Bible into the Belarusian language. He was behind the printing of the "Moscow Gospel" in the 1570s, and is regarded as one of the early facilitators of Belarusian printed literature. His Bible is sometimes understood to have been printed in Ukrainian but is today generally regarded as Belarusian language.
