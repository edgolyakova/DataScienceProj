His father worked as a valuation surveyor while his mother ran a bookshop. When his mother's bookshop closed, the books were stocked at home, something that introduced Mulumba to reading early in his life and sparked a desire for storytelling.He studied at Bishop Ddungu Boarding Primary School, Blessed Sacrament Kimaanya Primary School, St. Henry's College Kitovu, and then Makerere University, where he obtained a Bachelor of Science degree in Land Economics. Writing Mulumba's first collection of poems, Poetry in Motion, was called "an enterprising first" by the Africa Book Club.The Daily Monitor called it "an anthology that chronicles the first steps of a poet, and captures the beliefs, experiences and some ideologies in society".His story "Chasing my tail" was runner-up for the October 2013 Africa Book Club short reads competition. Another story, "Into the Bush", was the winning story in December 2013 for the same monthly competition.His work has also been featured on the Pan-African poetry platform Badilisha Poetry Radio.
