Roy Lewis (6 November 1913 – 9 October 1996) was an English writer and small press printer. Life and work Although born in Felixstowe, Lewis was brought up in Birmingham and educated at King Edward's School. After studying at University College, Oxford, earning his BA in 1934, he went on to study at the London School of Economics. He began his career as an economist, but after serving as an editor on the journal The Statist, he became interested in journalism. He took a sabbatical in 1938 to travel to Australia and India. He married Christine Tew in 1939, after returning to England. They had two daughters. Beginning in July 1939 he collaborated with Randal Heymanson to produce a newsletter called Vital News that they distributed confidentially to British and American government policymakers and bankers until December 1941.From 1943 to 1946, he worked for the Peking Syndicate, a firm specialising in investments in China, but left to work as a journalist for the weekly, Scope. Hired by the The Economist magazine, he served as its Washington, DC correspondent from 1952 to 1961. He settled full-time in England in 1961, where he became a feature writer for The Times, remaining with the newspaper until he retired in 1971. In 1957 he had set up the Keepsake Press, initially to hand-print family ephemera. He soon began serious, though small-scale, production and by the time infirmity forced him to discontinue in 1990 he had brought out over a hundred titles. The majority of the books that Lewis wrote or edited, often jointly, were nonfiction and closely related to his journalism. However, he is best known for his 1960 novel The Evolution Man, which went through six editions under a number of titles. This comic novel purports to be a first-hand account by the son of the first man to discover fire. To prevent further "advances", the family takes matters in hand, leading to a conclusion given away by the book's eventual subtitle, "How I ate my father". (The 2015 film Animal Kingdom: Let's Go Ape is based on this.) Continuing authorship into old age, Lewis published a second novel in 1990, the same year that a play of his on William Shakespeare was performed in the Edinburgh Festival Fringe, followed by a novella in 1991 and a further novel in 1995. All three of these later fictions were provocative reinterpretations of Victorian times. Legacy The Keepsake Poems project has been continued by another private press, Happy Dragons' Press.
