The film, due for release in September 2020, looks at the challenges of making wine in a region that has always witnessed upheaval and yet one which around 3,500 years ago, via the Phoenician traders, gave the gift of wine to the world. The documentary charts this historical journey, focusing mainly on testimonies from winemakers and other Lebanese from latter part of the 20th Century, in particular those who endured the 1975-91 civil war and the 2006 summer war and who continue to be affected by the ongoing conflict in neighbouring Syria and the political instability that defines Lebanon and the wider Middle East. Their astonishing stories tell of bravery, determination, and survival and how wine can be a unifier and a metaphor for life, hospitality, civilization, and above all a force for good in a region defined by turmoil and animosity.
