Author
Over the course of his career, Rowe wrote six published novels and a Time-Life history book on Australian soldiers in the Vietnam War.
In 1968, Maj. John Rowe wrote his first novel on the Vietnam War while serving in Washington, D.C. with the Defense Intelligence Agency. The book "Count Your Dead" was published by Angus & Robertson. An article on Rowe's book written by John Miles called "Soldier’s Bitter Vietnam Book" was later published in a 16 August 1968 newspaper article for The Adelaide Advertiser in Australia.
In 2003, "Count Your Dead" was selected by the Sydney University Press for inclusion in their Classic Works series of 25 books by Australian authors both living and dead.
In 2012, The Australian beat writer Peter Pierce wrote an article on Rowe's book "Count Your Dead" called "Kill by Kill, Name by Name".  Pierce states that Rowe condemned the vacillations and complacency of Australian politics including the foreign relations and the dependence on its major allies. Rowe resigned from the army after the book was published and returned to Australia.
