Robert Huish (1777 – April 1850) was a prolific English author of history books, novels, and miscellaneous other works.

Life
The son of Mark Huish of Nottingham, he was born there in 1777. He wrote a short treatise on bee-culture, which was afterwards expanded and issued in various forms. His other works are nearly all poor examples of anecdotal, quasi-historical bookmaking; the Quarterly Review spoke of him as an obscure and unscrupulous scribbler. He was prolific, as witnessed by his voluminous compilations during 1835–6. He executed a few translations from the German, and in his later years some novels. Nearly all his books exhibit anti-Tory prejudices. He died in Camberwell in April 1850.
