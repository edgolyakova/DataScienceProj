Merle Thornton (born 1930) is an Australian feminist activist, author and academic. She is best known for her 1965 action at the Regatta Hotel where she and Rosalie Bogner chained themselves to a bar rail to protest the exclusion of serving women in public bars in Queensland, Australia.Women's rights and social justice are threads linking Thornton's diverse range of pursuits and projects, including the 1965 founding of the Equal Opportunities Association for Women, helping establish the first Women's Studies course at the University of Queensland in 1973, and contributing to feminist and social theory literature. Education Thornton graduated with a Bachelor of Arts (Honours) from the University of Sydney in 1952 and studied Philosophy as a post-graduate at the University of Queensland. Feminist activism and career Thornton was involved in feminist activism beginning in the mid-1960s, including the notable Regatta Hotel protest in March 1965 that challenged women's exclusion from public bars in Queensland. In 1970 the law was changed to allow women to drink in public bars in Queensland. In April of the same year, Thornton founded the Equal Opportunities for Women Association in Brisbane. As President of the association, Thornton led a successful campaign for the removal of the marriage bar in the Commonwealth and State Public Services. The end of the marriage bar was legislated in 1966.From 1960 to 1980, Thornton worked as an academic in a variety of positions within Philosophy, Government, Sociology and Gender Studies at the University of Queensland (UQ). During her time there, Thornton helped to establish the first Women's Studies course in Queensland in the UQ's Sociology Department in 1973. Regatta Hotel protest In March 1965, Thornton and Rosalie Bogner chained themselves to the bar rail of the Regatta Hotel in Toowong, Brisbane as a protest to the exclusion of serving women in pubs. The women were refused service as serving them liquor would have resulted in a fine for the pub. However, “sympathetic male patrons” brought them beer.In Archiving the feminist self: reflections on the personal papers of Merle Thornton, Margaret Henderson notes that the protest “occurred four years before the first women’s liberation group met in Australia.” The protest marked the beginning of second wave feminist action in Brisbane and gained significant media coverage. Thornton and Bogner's protest, which addressed the public-private split for women, is recognised as a defining moment in the women's liberation movement in Australia. Kay Saunders notes, "when you use the term ‘‘second wave’’ it actually started in Brisbane."Thornton stated, "What we did at the Regatta represented an idea whose time had come. It was the idea of ending the confinement of women to the private domestic world."The public's reaction to the protest was mixed. Thornton received hate-mail letters accusing her of being a communist, questioned her mothering capabilities, and cast doubts on her morality. In 2014, the Regatta Hotel celebrated the protest with the naming of Merle's Bar. In 2009 as part of the Q150 celebrations, the 1965 Regatta Hotel protest was announced as a “Q150 Icon” under the category of a "Defining Moment" for Queensland.Thornton campaigned for women's issues throughout her life including demanding equal pay for women and removing the marriage bar for women in public service.

Thornton's screenwriting appears on several episodes of the popular Australian television series Prisoner.
