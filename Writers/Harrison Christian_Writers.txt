Harrison Christian (born 14 December 1990) is a New Zealand journalist and author. His first book, Men Without Country (2021) tells the story of the 1789 mutiny on the Royal Navy vessel HMS Bounty. Christian is a direct descendant of Fletcher Christian, the leader of the Bounty mutiny. Writing career Men Without Country was a bestseller in New Zealand. The book is critical of historians' attempts to portray the Bounty's commander, Lieutenant William Bligh, in a sympathetic light. Christian argues that Bligh's account of the mutiny was inaccurate, and that Bligh and his editors "worked together to turn the story into a work of propaganda through the ommission of key details".Christian's second book, Should We Fall to Ruin, takes an Anzac perspective of the Japanese invasion of Rabaul, New Guinea, in 1942. It received praise from The Sydney Morning Herald and The Saturday Paper. Works Men Without Country: The true story of exploration and rebellion in the South Seas. Ultimo Press. 2021.
