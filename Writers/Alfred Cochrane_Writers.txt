He was educated at Repton School and made his debut for Derbyshire in the 1884 season in August against Lancashire, when he took 6 for 51. He played two more matches for Derbyshire during the season. He also played football for Derby County in 1884 in its pre-league days.Cochrane went on to Hertford College, Oxford and played cricket more regularly for University over the next four years, taking part three times in the Varsity match. He played two matches for Derbyshire in the 1885 season, neither of which was against a first-class side, and played only in the Derbyshire match against the Australians in the 1886 season. In 28 first-class matches he took 103 wickets with his left arm medium pace, with a best performance of 7 for 66, at an average of just 18.99.Cochrane moved to Northumberland when he joined Armstrong Whitworth, becoming secretary of the company.

He wrote of cricket – the "uncertain game" – and of "the man who snicketh the length ball." He was interested in the nineteenth-century writers of light verse, especially in J K S (James Kenneth Stephen) and Winthrop Mackworth Praed with whom his verse was compared. Of football he wrote in the poem "To Anthea". I once admitted—to my shame— That football was a brutal game. Because She hates it.Later he recalled with nostalgia the expeditions in the Highlands of his youth, and lamented that "the way, though once it was short, is long."   He contributed to The Times for many years on sporting topics, especially on cricket. Cochrane died at Batheaston, Somerset at the age of 83. Cochrane married in 1895 Ethel Noble youngest daughter of Sir Andrew Noble, 1st Baronet. He was the brother of Sir Arthur Cochrane a distinguished member of the College of Arms and Charles Walter Hamilton Cochrane of the Federated Malay States service.
