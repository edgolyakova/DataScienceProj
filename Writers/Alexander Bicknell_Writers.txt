Alexander Bicknell (died 1796), author, was an industrious litt√©rateur of the last quarter of the eighteenth century, whose writings received ridicule or faint praise in the British periodical Monthly Review. It has been suggested that he also wrote under the pseudonym of Mrs Elizabeth Steele. He died 22 August 1796 in St. Thomas's Hospital, London.
