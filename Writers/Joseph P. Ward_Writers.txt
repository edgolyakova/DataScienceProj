Biography
Joseph Ward grew up in Southern New England, seeing massive upheaval from the loss of manufacturing jobs, a change he later credited for his interest in history. Ward earned his Bachelor of Arts in history at University of Chicago and received a masters and a doctorate in history from Stanford University. In 2017 he was made the head of the search committee for Utah State's next provost, a position previously held by current president Noelle E. Cockett. That search eventually led to hiring of Frank Galey.
