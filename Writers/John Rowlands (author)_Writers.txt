Biography
Born in Trawsfynydd, Merionethshire, Rowlands graduated in Welsh from Bangor University in 1959 and went on to lecture at Abertawe/Swansea, Coleg y Drindod, Caerfyrddin,  Llanbedr Pont Steffan  and Aberystwyth. He retired in 2003 but remained active as an editor, critic and judge. In retirement he worked on creative writing courses at Bangor.
His academic work included editing a major literary series Y Meddwl a'r Dychymyg Cymreig and numerous volumes and papers.
