Stephen Bourne (born 31 October 1957) is a British writer, film and social historian specialising in Black heritage and gay culture. As noted by the BBC among others, Bourne "has discovered many stories that have remained untold for years".In October 2019, Booker Prize winner Bernardine Evaristo voted Bourne for her Black History Month hero on Facebook. She said: "Stephen Bourne is a hero of our history, who has published countless books, always accessible to all, on the hidden stories of our presence on these shores. Let's honour Stephen for quietly shining a light on our history."In 2019, the acclaimed writer Russell T Davies (Queer as Folk, It's a Sin) described Bourne in his foreword to Playing Gay in the Golden Age of British Television as "one of the soldiers, gatekeepers and champions of our community. I am in awe of his diligence and insight." Early life and education Bourne was born in Camberwell, south-east London, and raised in Peckham. He attended Oliver Goldsmith Primary School from 1962 to 1969 and St. Michael and All Angels Secondary Modern School from 1969 to 1974. He left school educationally disadvantaged in 1974 but was encouraged to join the sixth form of Archbishop Temple's, a comprehensive school in Lambeth, from 1974 to 1975. When Temple's closed, he transferred to the sixth form of Archbishop Michael Ramsey Comprehensive School in Camberwell.Though Bourne did not do well enough to go to university, he later graduated from the London College of Printing (now known as the London College of Communication) with a bachelor's degree in film and television in 1988, and in 2006 received a Master of Philosophy degree at De Montfort University on the subject of the representation of gay men in British Television Drama 1936–79. Career After graduating in 1988, he was a research officer at the British Film Institute on a ground-breaking project that documented the history of Black people in British television. The result was a two-part television documentary called Black and White in Colour (BBC 1992), directed by Isaac Julien.In 1991, Bourne was a founder member of the Black and Asian Studies Association with, amongst others, Hakim Adi and Marika Sherwood. Since 2004 he has written more than fifty entries for the Oxford Dictionary of National Biography. In 2008 he researched Keep Smiling Through – Black Londoners on the Home Front 1939–1945, an exhibition for the Cuming Museum in the London Borough of Southwark and that same year he worked as a historical consultant on the Imperial War Museum's War to Windrush exhibition. Bonnie Greer, playwright and critic, has said: "Stephen Bourne brings great natural scholarship and passion to a largely hidden story. He is highly accessible, accurate and surprising. You always walk away from his work knowing something that you didn't know, that you didn't even suspect". In 1991, Bourne co-authored The Sun Shone on Our Side of the Street: Aunt Esther's Story with Esther Bruce (his adopted aunt), which was published by the Ethnic Communities Oral History Project (ECOHP). He has written books about significant Black personalities such as Elisabeth Welch, Ethel Waters, Evelyn Dove and Harold Moody, as well as about different aspects of the historical Black presence in Britain.  In 2014, Bourne's book Black Poppies: Britain's Black Community and the Great War was published by The History Press. Reviewing it in The Independent, Bernardine Evaristo said: "Until historians and cultural map-makers stop ignoring the historical presence of people of colour, books such as this one provide a powerful, revelatory counterbalance to the whitewashing of British history."A contributor to the gay press for many years, Bourne was the film critic for Gay Times in the early 1990s, and in 1996 his acclaimed book Brief Encounters, a survey of gay cinema in Britain, was published. In 1992 he curated Out of the Archives, the first of many successful LGBT television retrospectives for BFI Southbank. In 1995, in the London Borough of Southwark, Bourne was instrumental in setting up one of the first locally-based multi-agency forums to combat homophobic crime. Since 1999 he has been active in his community as an independent adviser to the Metropolitan Police. From 1998 to 2005, Bourne was a regular contributor to Black Filmmaker Magazine (bfm), the first Black film publication aimed at the global black filmmaking industry. It was founded and edited by the film-maker Menelik Shabazz. Following the publication of the Commission on Race and Ethnic Disparities in March 2021, Bourne revealed he was listed as a contributor to the report without his knowledge, stating that he felt manipulated. Awards In 2002 Bourne received the Metropolitan Police Volunteer Award for his work as independent adviser on critical incidents. It was presented to him by Police Commissioner Sir John Stevens at City Hall, London. In 2013 Bourne was nominated for a Southwark Heritage Blue Plaque for his work as a community historian and Southwark Police independent adviser. He came second with 1,025 votes. In June 2015, at Southwark's Unicorn Theatre, the Southwark Arts Forum presented Bourne with their Literature Award for Black Poppies. In May 2017, he was honoured at the 12th Screen Nation Awards with a special award for his years of work documenting the lives of Black Britons in film and television. In 2017 he received an Honorary Fellowship from London South Bank University for his contribution to diversity. In 2022 Bourne was shortlisted for The Society for Theatre Research book prize for Deep Are the Roots: Trailblazers Who Changed Black British Theatre.
