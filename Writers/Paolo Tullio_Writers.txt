Tullio came to Ireland in 1968 to study English, arts and philosophy at Trinity College, where he obtained an MA. After his study he held several jobs, working as a clinical psychologist in St. Brendan's Hospital, an interpreter and as a cattle-agent.

Armstrong's Barn
In 1977 Tullio took over Armstrong's Barn, serving food in a traditional Irish style. The restaurant closed in 1988.

After the demise of the studio, he renovated the building and turned it into a house.Tullio sold "Annaglen", the dwelling house attached to Armstrong's Barn, and moved into Armstrong's Barn itself. Before selling off Armstrong's Barn in 2003, he built a smaller house in a field close by.He received several culinary awards for his cooking. In 1978 Armstrong's Barn was awarded one Michelin star.
