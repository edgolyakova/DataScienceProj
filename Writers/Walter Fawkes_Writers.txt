He did much towards the improvement of his estates, and was successful as a breeder of cattle, his shorthorns being well known. With Jonas Whitaker of Burley-in-Wharfedale and the Rev. J. A.

The park which he formed at Caley Hall was stocked with red and fallow deer, zebras, wild hogs, and a species of deer from India.Fawkes enlarged the family mansion at Farnley, which he adorned with collections. He died in London on 24 October 1825, and was buried in the family vault at Otley. Works Fawkes was a cultivated writer as well as a patron of the fine arts.
