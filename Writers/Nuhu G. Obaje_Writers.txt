Professor Nuhu George Obaje (born 15 December 1961) is a professor and Director in the Centre for Applied Sciences and Technology Research (CASTER) at the Ibrahim Badamasi Babangida University Lapai, Niger State. Biography Born and raised in Ajaka village in Igalamela local government area of Kogi state a village at Kogi state. In 1974, he attended Barewa College Zaria for his senior school leaving certificate and graduated in 1979. After-which he proceeded to study Geology at the Ahmadu Bello University Zaria graduating in 1984. By 1987, he received his M.Sc. degree and furthered for his PhD in 1994 at University of Tuebingen, Germany.Professor Obaje was in 2019, appointed as pioneer head of the Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation (NNPC) professorial chair at Ibrahim Badamasi Babangida University Lapai (IBBUL), in Niger state. Prior, he had advocated the prospecting of oil in the seven hydrocarbon basins including Sokoto and Bida. Consequently, he was made the NNPC Chair in Basinal Studies. Awards and recognition Awards: Royal Society of London (RSL) post-doctoral fellowship in Petroleum Geochemistry at the University of Aberdeen, Scotland, in 1997 The German Academic Exchange Service (GAES) postdoctoral fellowship in biostratigraphy at the University of Tuebingen, in 1998. The Alexander von Humboldt research fellowship in organic geochemistry/organic petrology at the Federal Institute for Geosciences and Natural Resources in Hannover/Germany, on two separate occasions.
