Eveline Willett Cunnington (23 April 1849 â€“ 30 July 1916) was a British-born social reformer, feminist, lecturer and writer in New Zealand.

Early life and education
Cunnington was born Eveline Willett Leach in Briton Ferry, Glamorganshire, Wales, on 23 April 1849. Her father, Robert Valentine Leach, owned a lunatic asylum. As a young woman, Cunningham wanted to get a job, but her father would not allow it.  He sent her to school in France, after which she spent time in Italy and Germany.  Back in England, Cunnington attended at Queen's College in London for three years. 
In 1875, Cunnington emigrated to Christchurch, New Zealand.  On 8 April 1876, she married Capel Baines.  The couple moved to South Australia, where he worked as a clerk. They lived in poverty; Cunnington later stated that this experience radicalized her feelings on the subject.  Cunningham had two children in Australia.
In August 1883, on a visit to Cunnington's family in England, Capel died of a heart attack.  She and her children left England for Christchurch.  On 18 December 1884, she married Herbert James Cunnington, an electrical engineer, in Leithfield.  The couple had one daughter.
