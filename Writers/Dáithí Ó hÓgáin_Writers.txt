His doctoral thesis at UCD, overseen by Bo Almqvist was later republished as An File in 1983.  Its theme was the lore on how poets received the gift of poetry, and the supernatural powers poetry could manifest according to folk tradition.

One notable effort was the massive tome, Myth, Legend and Romance - an Encyclopaedia of the Irish Folk Tradition (1990), later reissued under the title The Lore of Ireland: an Encyclopaedia of Myth, Legend and Romance (2006), covering a wide range of folkloric material, from ancient times into the modern.He was instrumental in drafting UNESCO's recommendations on the protection of world folklore in 1987, and was co-founder of the European Center for Traditional Culture in Budapest in 1994. He rose from associate professor to professor at the Folklore Department at UCD, but was forced into early retirement in 2009 due to failing health.He has lectured and read his poetry throughout Ireland and other countries: England, Comre, Scotland, France, Monaco, Belgium, Germany, Poland, Lithuania, Estonia, Russia, Hungary and Iceland.
