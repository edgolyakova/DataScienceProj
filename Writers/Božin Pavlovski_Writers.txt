Božin Pavlovski (Macedonian: Божин Павловски) is a Macedonian-Australian novelist whose works have been translated into more than twenty languages.  He is a novelist–mediator between two cultures whose novels interpret the binary logic by which his characters are both “here” and in the country in which they were born or originate from. 
He was born in Žvan, Demir Hisar, Macedonia, on January 7, 1942. He has lived in the former Yugoslavia and the United States, but he has been based in Melbourne, Australia, since 1991. Pavlovski studied literature at the University of Skopje and graduated in 1971. For over thirty years he was editor and publisher of world literature in the former Yugoslavia. Since 1989, he has divided his time as a professional novelist traveling between Europe and Australia.
Bozin Pavlovski's novels, particularly those he has written since he has adopted Australia as his second homeland, unveil the phenomena of reterritorialized cultures and describe the meetings, conversations and thoughts of two or sometimes more cultures, communities, and languages which exist in a single space. Pavlovski's novels can be said to be a part of a transnational literature which has an increasing importance in a contemporary world whose significant characteristics are those of dislocation and relocation, and from where stems his writing between histories, geographies and cultural practices.
