Gustav Kadelburg (26 January 1851, in Pest – 11 September 1925, in Berlin) was a Hungarian-German Jewish actor, dramatist, writer.
He made his first appearance at Leipzig in 1869, and two years later played at the Wallnertheater in Berlin. He was very successful in comedy parts, but abandoned the stage to write comedies and farces.
In 1908, The Manchester Guardian reviewed Der Weg zur Holle ("The Road to Hell"), his farce over three acts, then playing at the Midland Theatre. While chiding the lack of originality, the reviewer praised the pace - neither too quick to exhaust nor too slow to see the chinks.

His best-known plays (some written in conjunction with Franz von Schönthan and Oscar Blumenthal) are:
