Andrew Wynter (1819- 12 May 1876, Chiswick) was an English physician and author.
Born in Bristol, Wynter studied medicine at St George's Hospital and set up a London practice.  He edited the British Medical Journal 1845–60, took a M.D. in 1853 and became a member of the College of Physicians in 1861.  Wynter was a frequent contributor to periodicals, including Ainsworth's Magazine, the Cornhill Magazine, Fraser's Magazine, the Edinburgh Review, the Quarterly Review, the London Review, Good Words, and Once a Week.  Many of his contributions were collected and reissued as books.  As a doctor, Wynter specialized in insanity, taking wealthy patients as residents at his Chiswick home.
