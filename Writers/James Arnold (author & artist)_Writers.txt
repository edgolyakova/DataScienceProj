James Arnold (2 July 1909 – 7 September 1999) was an English commercial artist who developed a passion for the wagons that he saw on his cycling tours of the countryside in the pre- and post-War years. He set about producing painstakingly accurate measured drawings and watercolours of all the main regional types that he came across and these he included in a series of books beginning with The Joyous Wheel (1940) and including The Farm Waggons of England and Wales (1969). Life Arnold was born in Southall, Middlesex on 2 July 1909.Never owning a car, he cycled all his life, claiming to have covered nearly half a million miles in his lifetime. In November 1946 he became a founding member of the Birmingham-based Beacon Roads Cycling Club.
