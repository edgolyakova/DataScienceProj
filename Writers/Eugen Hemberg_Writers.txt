Education and Career Hemberg graduated with a degree in forestry from the Swedish Forestry Institute ("Skogsinstitutet") in 1869. After graduation, he began making long trips to Russia, Finland, Poland, Germany, and the Krkonose mountains, where he explored and documented the local forestry and hunting. Upon Hemberg's return to Sweden in 1874, he began working in forestry management for the Swedish government in Kalix and Arljeplog, until 1878. Towards the end of the 19th century, he returned to Russia to continue documenting its hunting and forestry practices (1898-1899).

Furthermore, he wrote the following historical fiction: Stenåldershorden (1923) ('The Stone-Age Hoard'), and Varjagerna (1924) ('The Wolf Hunters').
