Later career and writing Although Wade continued to act occasionally for many years, his theatrical interests gradually moved towards direction. He produced 14 plays for the Incorporated Stage Society and almost all the revivals of the Phoenix Society (1919), of which he was one of the four founders. He translated plays by Giraudoux and Cocteau into English.In his spare time Wade formed extensive collections of the works and fugitive pieces of his favourite living writers – W. B. Yeats, Henry James, Joseph Conrad and Max Beerbohm, hunting out their anonymous contributions to periodicals and copying them out by hand in the British Museum. In 1948 he edited James's then unknown dramatic criticism as The Scenic Art, published by Rupert Hart-Davis in 1950, with an introduction by Leon Edel.Wade was a friend of Yeats and in 1908 his interim bibliography appeared in Bullen's collected edition of Yeats's works; later he published the standard bibliography. He went on to collect, edit and annotate the Letters of W.B. Yeats (1954) and at the time of his death was far advanced in collecting and editing the letters of Oscar Wilde.Wade died suddenly on 12 July 1955 aged 74, leaving a widow, Margot, whom he married in 1933.
