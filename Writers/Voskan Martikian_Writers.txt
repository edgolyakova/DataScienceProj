He headed the Ottoman Post-Telegraph Service and introduced many reforms that found much opposition. After the governmental elections of the Ottoman parliament, he was elected as member of parliament.Nationalist editor Hüseyin Cahit Yalçın of the newspaper Tanin slandered Martikian claiming that he had drafted the new Ottoman banknotes to an Armenian and that cryptic Armenian codes were contained in its print. An Ottoman commission investigated the accusations and rebuffed the slanders against Martikian. However, his reputation was severely damaged as a trustworthy politician amongst the Young Turks. At the start of the First World War in 1914, when the Ottoman Parliament was debating whether it should join the war, Martikian made no secret of his disapproval of entry. This created a further rift between the Ottoman authorities and himself. Under much pressure, he resigned from his seat in the parliament.In 1918, Voskan Martikian traveled to Europe and became an auditor at various universities. The newly formed Iraqi government invited Martikian to serve and he was awarded the title of “bey”.
