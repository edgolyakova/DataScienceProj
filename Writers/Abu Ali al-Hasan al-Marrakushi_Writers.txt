Abu Ali al-Hassan al-Marrakushi (Arabic: الحسن المراكشي; Berber languages: ⵍⵃⴰⵙⴰⵏ ⴰⵎⵔⵔⴰⴽⵛⵉ; fl. late 13th century) was a Moroccan astronomer and mathematician from the Kingdom of Morocco . He was especially important in the field of trigonometry and practical astronomy. He wrote Jāmiʿ al-mabādiʾ wa’l-ghāyāt fī ʿilm al-mīqāt (Collection of the Principles and Objectives in the Science of Timekeeping), a treatise on spherical astronomy and astronomical instruments. The first part was translated into French by the orientalist and astronomer Jean Jacques Emmanuel Sédillot during the early 19th century, and published after Sédillot's death.The treatise, which was written in Cairo between 1276 and 1282, is regarded as the most complete source to have survived about medieval Islamic astronomical instruments. Legacy The crater Al-Marrakushi on the Moon is named after him. References Sources Charette, François (2007). "Marrākushī: Sharaf al‐Dīn Abū ʿAlī al‐Ḥasan ibn ʿAlī ibn ʿUmar al‐Marrākushī".
