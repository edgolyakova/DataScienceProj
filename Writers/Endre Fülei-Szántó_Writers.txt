Endre Fülei-Szántó (September 28, 1924 – January 16, 1995) was a Hungarian linguist, author and professor.

Biography
His father Endre Fülei-Szántó senior (1890-1958) was a lawyer, university professor and writer from Transylvania.
His grandfather was Lajos Fülei Szántó, writer, poet, publicist. His great-grandfather was furrier, studied in Germany, then returned home to Székelyudvarhely (Odorheiu Secuiesc). His mother was a literary translator. Her parents were deported in 1951 and her father was imprisoned.His children were born to his first wife Frigyesy Olga. András (1964-) and Éva (1968-) Grandchildren. In 1944 he became a law student and in 1948 he received a doctorate in law and political science from Pázmány Péter University. Endre Fülei-Szántó studied at the Piarist Gymnasium in Budapest. He graduated in philosophy and psychology he received a degree in French as a linguist he studied economics for two semesters. In 1944–45, he was a member of the resistance, doing increasingly desperate political work within the youth group of the Smallholders' Party. In 1948 he was arrested and transferred to the Hadik barracks (Budapest, Bartók Béla út 24–26). From 1945, the building became the headquarters of the Ministry of Defence, Military Policy Department (Katpol), which was under communist influence, and in the basement of the building cellar prisons were built. György Kardos was interrogated. He offered him either to apply for admission to the secret service and become an external collaborator, or, as he spent too much time at the French Institute, to be arrested as a spy. György Kardos encouraged him with the words: "I don't have much interest in you, but it's not impossible that you will be a useful external collaborator". Endre Fülei-Szántó signed the application to become an external collaborator and was released. He tried to escape to the West, but was caught. The Military High Court sentenced him to life imprisonment in the first instance and to ten years in the second instance. Between 1948 and 1956, he served eight years in Váci prison.  In March 1951, a new prisoner arrived at the prison, who was György Kardos and they got to know each other, and were prison mates for five years. He was put in the same cell with many others, from the defendants in the Rajk trial to veterans of the Spanish Civil War. That's how he learned Spanish. His Spanish teachers in prison were Pál Ignotus, József Hatvany, László Mátyás and Béla Szász. The many sufferings of prison could not change the basic traits of his personality: the young man with a sparkling mind, a great sense of humour, courage, who saw the goodness in everyone, wrote plays for the prison theatre, debated, thought and made friends with many of his fellow prisoners of the most diverse political parties.After his release, he worked as an auxiliary worker for 6 years. In 1962 he was admitted to the Karl Marx University of Economics to teach language. He taught German, Spanish, French and English at the Language Institute of the Budapest University of Economics and Business. In 1965 he obtained a diploma as a secondary school teacher of Spanish and in 1983 a diploma as a secondary school teacher of English at Eötvös Loránd University. In 1971 he received the degree candidate of science. For a decade from 1966, he was the director of the Debrecen Summer University, where he directed the study of Hungarian for foreigners. The product of these experiences was his five-volume book Hungarian Language for Foreigners (Volumes I-V, TIT, Budapest, 1972). The Hungarian Language and Culture, 1972, "Hungarian for Foreigners", 1972-V. He and his colleagues taught Hungarian to Finns, Russians, Koreans and Venezuelans, English, Germans and people from twenty other countries from all over the world.Since 1982 he has been a professor at the Department of Hungarian Language at the Janus Pannonius University. Between 1986 and 1990, he spent four years as a visiting professor at the University of Bucharest, where he spent the last, extremely rough years of the Ceausescu era, earning the respect of many with friendship, love and wisdom. He lived through the fall of the dictatorship and the Romanian Revolution. He taught at the Department of Oriental Languages, Faculty of Philology, University of Bucharest, as a visiting lecturer under an interstate agreement. He wrote a wonderful book about Ceausescu, entitled Fortress in Captivity, a great blend of stylistic elegance and precise observations. Between 1990 and 1992 he organised the Spanish Department and the Spanish Faculty in Pécs. He created the Inter-Faculty Cooperation Circle, an academic forum of the four faculties of the university.From 1971 to 1976, he was the Hungarian representative of the FIPLV (International Federation of Language Teacher Associations) and a member of the international associations IDV (German), IATEFL (English) and AEPE (Spanish). He has organised and hosted numerous international and national conferences and courses, both as a lecturer and as a teacher. In 1991, he became co-president of the PEK (Political Convicts' Association: 1945–56) and since 1992 he has been a member of its executive committee. He was a member of the executive committee of the World Federation of Hungarians. In 1992 he was elected Honorary President of the Spanish-Hungarian Friendship Society of Pécs. In 1993 he was elected President of HONT (International Association of Hungarian Studies Teachers).In 1992, while still alive, he was awarded the Order of Merit of the Republic of Hungary.
