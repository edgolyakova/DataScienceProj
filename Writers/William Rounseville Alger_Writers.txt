Early life and education
William Rounseville Alger was born in Freetown, Massachusetts, on December 28, 1822 to Nahum and Catherine Sampson Alger, née Rounseville. He attended the academy at Pembroke, New Hampshire, working part-time at a cotton mill. Alger graduated from the Harvard Divinity School in 1847 and was ordained as a Unitarian minister in Roxbury, Massachusetts, where he preached until 1855.

Career
After 1855, Alger went to the Bulfinch Street Church in Boston, and preached around the country including in New York, Colorado, Illinois, Maine, Louisiana, and Rhode Island. He became well known in Boston for filling Tremont Temple.Alger was an active abolitionist and Free Mason, and a contributor to various periodicals including the Christian Examiner, which he co-edited in the 1860s. In 1857, he gave the annual Boston Fourth of July celebration day speech, in which he addressed the issue of slavery. His remarks were controversial and the city refused the usual publication of the speech. However, seven years later, the city government unanimously reversed their decision, publishing the speech and publicly thanking him for it.Alger was also the first regular pastor of the first Episcopalian church in Biddeford, Maine, which was built in 1869, as well as the All Souls Unitarian Church in Roxbury (also called the Mount Pleasant Congregational Church). He also served in The Church of the Messiah, an important Unitarian church in New York. He served as Chaplain of the Massachusetts House of Representatives. Harvey Jewell, the speaker of the Massachusetts House of Representatives was impressed by Alger's prayers and asked for his words to be taken down by the stenographer and published.
