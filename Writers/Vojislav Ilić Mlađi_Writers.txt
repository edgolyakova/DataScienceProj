Vojislav Ilić Mlađi (Serbian Cyrillic: Војислав Илић Млађи; 7 October 1877 – 22 May 1944) was a Serbian writer and poet.

Biography
He is often mistaken with the 19th-century Serbian poet Vojislav Ilić to whom he was not related although for a time they lived near each other in the part of Belgrade called Palilula. Due to their same name, surname and even the same middle initial and out of respect to the older Ilić, he added the title of Mlađi (the Younger) to his name.
