Biography
Born on 1 July 1953 in Differdange, he is the elder brother of the author Guy Helminger. After graduating from high school in 1972, Helminger went on to study German, Romance linguistics and drama in Luxembourg, Saarbr체cken, Vienna and Berlin. In 1980, he went to Paris where he taught German and history at secondary school. From 1984, he became an independent writer working in Munich, Heidelberg, Paris and Luxemburg, finally settling in Esch-sur-Alzette in 1999.Helminger has written socially critical plays such as Miss Minett und de schantchen in which he brings out the psychological and social problems suffered in the industrial south-western area of Luxembourg. Other works like Kitsch, L채schten eens k채e liewen, and Kurzgeschichten address domestic violence and loss of hope and purpose as symptoms of an inhuman, materialistic society. He ascribes these trends to the repression of political and social issues as a result of  the Second World War, the power of the church and the media. In his later works (In eigener s채ure, Grenzgang) he introduces increasingly poetic, intertextual and multilingual elements.
