He also wrote about the Lithuanian National Revival for the Polish weekly Kraj in Saint Petersburg. Adomaitis joined a group of Lithuanian students in Warsaw which established  Varpas and became its editor.Since Lithuanian-language publications were banned, he attracted police attention.

In 1894, he briefly returned to Lithuania to live with Vincas Kudirka, but soon emigrated to the United States.
