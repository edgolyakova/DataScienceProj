Lav Anikita Filolog (Serbian: Лав Аникита Филолог) was a late 15th and early 16th-century Serbian writer who worked mostly in Russia. An intense cultural exchange followed when Serbian intellectuals found refuge in Russia after the fall of the Serbian Despotate in 1459. One of such man of letters was Lav Anikita Filolog who wrote eulogies about Russian saints and boyars. Life and work At the time of the decline of Serbian literature when the Turks invaded the land, he became famous for his scholarship and literary skill, long before 1530, he was invited to Russia, where he wrote "A Word of Praise to Mikhail Chernigovsky and the Boyar Fyodor". Also, at the request of the monks of the Solovetsky Monastery, he wrote, returning to Serbia at the time, two letters of praise to the Solovetsky saints (Slovo Zosimu and Slovo Savatiju, both between 1534 and 1542) based on a reworking of older Russian non-literary versions. There are assumptions that Lav Anikita is the author of the anonymous "Life of Josif Volocki".
