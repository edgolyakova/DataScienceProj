Main Ideas Six Stages of Parenthood In 1987, Galinsky was the first to postulate that parents develop as their children grow. She devised six stages of parenthood and describes them in her book, The Six Stages of Parenthood. Galinsky's work on this book was influenced by Erik Erikson and Daniel Levinson. The Image-Making Stage This stage occurs during pregnancy and is characterized by the parents imaging what parenthood will look like. During this stage, parents consider what their roles will be and how they will parent. Further, they plan and make changes necessary for the care of an infant. The Nurturing Stage The nurturing stage begins when the child is born. It is characterized by forming a relationship and attachment with the child. Other relationships must be recreated to include their new child. This stage is the most challenging because their infant is completely dependent on the parent. The Authority Stage This stage happens when the child is two through five years old. This stage is characterized by rule-making and what to do when rules are broken. During this stage, kids are growing a sense of autonomy and the parents job is to decide how much autonomy to give them. The Interpretive Stage This stage occurs during middle childhood. During this stage, parents must decide where the kid should go to school, what extracurricular activities to be involved in, and more. This stage is characterized by parents reflecting on their parenting strategies and whether they have been successful. Further, parents must help their kids become more independent and guide them in making their own decisions. The Interdependent Stage This stage occurs when the child is a teenager. It is characterized by the parent and child sharing control and authority. The child starts making their own choices and the parent gives the child more freedoms. The Departure Stage This stage occurs when the eldest child first moves out until the youngest child moves out. This stage is characterized by transition and reflection. The role of parent becomes less important to their identity.
