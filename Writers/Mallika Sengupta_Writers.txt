Mallika Sengupta (Bengali: মল্লিকা সেনগুপ্ত; 1960–2011) was a Bengali poet, feminist, and reader of Sociology from Kolkata, known for her "unapologetically political poetry". Biography Mallika Sengupta was the head of the Department of Sociology in Maharani Kasiswari College, an undergraduate college affiliated with the University of Calcutta in Kolkata. She was much better known for her literary activity. The author of more than 20 books including 14 volumes of poetry and two novels, she was widely translated and was a frequent invitee at international literary festivals. For twelve years in the 90s she was the poetry editor of Sananda, the largest circulated Bengali fortnightly (edited by Aparna Sen). Along with her husband, the noted poet Subodh Sarkar, she was the founder-editor of Bhashanagar, a culture magazine in Bengali. English translations of her work have appeared in various Indian and American anthologies. In addition to teaching, editing and writing, she was actively involved with the cause of gender justice and other social issues. A victim of breast cancer, she was under treatment since October 2005 and died on 28 May 2011. Activism and literary themes Sengupta was also active in a number of protest and gender activism groups. Her fiery, combative tone is noticeable in many poems, e.g. "While teaching my son history": Man alone was both God and Goddess Man was both father and mother Both tune and flute Both penis and vagina As we have learnt from history. – from Mallika Sengupta, Kathamanabi, Bhashanagar, kolkata, 2005, (tr. poet)often dealing with women's marginalised role in history: after the battle said chenghis khan the greatest pleasure of life, is in front of the vanquished enemy to sleep with his favourite wife. – Juddha Sheshe Nari – from Mallika Sengupta, Kathamanabi, Bhashanagar, kolkata, 2005, (tr. amitabha mukerjee)Particularly evocative is her feminist rendition of the legend of Khana, a medieval female poet whose tongue was allegedly cut off by her jealous husband: In Bengal in the Middle Ages Lived a woman Khana, I sing her life The first Bengali woman poet Her tongue they severed with a knife Her speechless voice, "Khanar Bachan" Still resonates in the hills and skies Only the poet by the name of Khana Bleeding she dies. – Khana, tr. amitabha mukerjee Awards and honours Junior Fellowship for Literature from the Dept. of Culture, Govt. of India (1997–99) Sukanto Puroskar from the Govt. of West Bengal (1998) Bangla Academy award from the Govt. of West Bengal (2004) Has been invited to poetry readings, conferences and seminars in Sweden (1987), Australia (1994), USA (2002 & 2006), Czech Republic (2009) and Bangladesh (1998 & 2002) as part of Indian writer's delegation.
