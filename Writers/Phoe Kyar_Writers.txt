U Phoe Kyar (Burmese: ဖိုးကျား, pronounced [pʰó tɕá]; also spelled Pho Kyar; 23 March 1891 – 11 April 1942) is considered one of the top Burmese authors and education reformists in 20th century Myanmar. He is regarded as the father of Burmese short stories, a key member of the Nationalist Education movement of the 1930s and also a literary genius. His works continue to be popular with both the young and old in Myanmar.

He passed the government college matriculation exam only at the age of 27 and then proceeded to Judson College (now part of Rangoon University) in Rangoon (Yangon).
