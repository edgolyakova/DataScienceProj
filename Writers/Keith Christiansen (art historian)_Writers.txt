The post was published on Juneteenth and considered by some to be a commentary on certain "Black Lives Matter" protestors. Therein a letter was sent to the museum's leadership by staff members asking for recognition of "what we see as the expression of a deeply rooted logic of white supremacy and culture of systemic racism at our institution.” A day before the staff letter was sent Christiansen apologized to the European paintings department calling his Instagram post "not only not appropriate and misguided in its judgment but simply wrong.” Christiansen had uploaded a picture of a pen and ink drawing by the archaeologist Alexandre Lenoir (1769–1831) of his efforts to try to save monuments during the French Revolution and had the caption "Alexandre Lenoir battling the revolutionary zealots bent on destroying the royal tombs in Saint Denis. How many great works of art have been lost to the desire to rid ourselves of a past of which we don’t approve"...
