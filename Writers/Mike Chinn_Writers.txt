Mike Chinn is a horror, fantasy, science fiction and comics writer from Birmingham, England. Chinn has been nominated for the British Fantasy Award for Best Collection and Best Short Story. He created the Anglerre fantasy series and Robot Kid science fiction books for the Starblazer comic, published by D. C. Thomson & Co. Ltd. Starblazer has been resurrected as a licensed role-playing game from Cubicle 7 Entertainment, entitled Starblazer Adventures. Chinn has contributed to the RPG supplement Legends of Anglerre, based on the Anglerre world and characters that he created for Starblazer. In 1998, Midlands-based, British Fantasy Award winning publisher The Alchemy Press published their first paperback: six short stories featuring Chinn's pulp adventure heroes, Damian Paladin and adventuress Leigh Oswin, The Paladin Mandates (which was itself short listed in the 1999 British Fantasy Awards, Best Collection and Best Short Story categories). In 2017, Pro Se Productions published further adventures of Paladin and Leigh in Walkers in Shadow. In 2015 the first of his Sherlock Holmes related pastiches was published. He has edited four anthologies for The Alchemy Press: Swords Against the Millennium and three volumes of The Alchemy Press Book of Pulp Heroes.
