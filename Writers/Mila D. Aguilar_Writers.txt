Biography
In 1971, Aguilar went underground, disagreeing with the policies of the Philippine government; she was arrested in 1984.
Aguilar has also written more than a hundred essays. A handful of these were done when she went "underground", first as an ordinary member, later as head of the Regional United Front Commission of Mindanao, and finally as head of the National United Front Commission of the Communist Party of the Philippines, the rebel organization from which she resigned in 1984.
She has produced, written, and directed almost 50 videos on subjects ranging from community organizations to regional cultures and good manners for government employees.
As a "webweaver", a term she invented, she has designed her own web pages as well as the website of a non-governmental organization.
She taught at the Department of English and Comparative Literature of the University of the Philippines, Diliman from 1969-1971, and again from 2000-2006.
She also taught at St Joseph's College after her release from prison in 1986.
Her full autobiography is entitled The Nine Deaths of M. It is a Kindle book and can be downloaded on Amazon.
