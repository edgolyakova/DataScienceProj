Mick Mercer (born Michael Mercer, 2 June 1957) is a journalist and author best known for his books, photos and reviews of the goth, punk and indie music scenes. Life and work Mercer is primarily a writer focused on the gothic scene and its music. He has also photographed bands from the punk era onwards. He published a monthly online magazine, The Mick, for over ten years and now hosts a weekly live internet radio show, Mick Mercer Radio. Mercer ran one of the first punk fanzines, Panache, from 1976 to 1992. In 1978, he began writing for British music paper Record Mirror, then freelanced for ZigZag magazine, later becoming its editor until the magazine folded in 1986. During the 1980s, he wrote regularly for the British music weekly Melody Maker, and edited Siren magazine in the 1990s. He has written five books on gothic music, and self-published over 100 books, available through his website. He occasionally publishes reviews of records, visible on his Facebook pages. Mercer's Music to Die For compendium (2009) was described by The Quietus as having "a far greater stylistic variety than the casual observer might imagine", and as being "stuffed full of the best and most artistic music the world has to offer". Mercer married in 2016, and appeared to have retired from the fanzine profession, but Panache will now be returning in free pdf format via his website and also as a self-published print entity.
