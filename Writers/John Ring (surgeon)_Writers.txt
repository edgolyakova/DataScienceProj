John Ring (1752–1821) was an English surgeon, vaccination activist, and man of letters. Life The son of Richard Ring, he was born at Wincanton in Somerset, and was baptised there on 21 August 1752. He entered Winchester College in 1765, and left it in 1767–8. He then went to London, where he attended the lectures of Percivall Pott, John Hunter and William Hunter.Ring received the diploma of the Surgeons' Company on 1 September 1774, and went into practise in London. He became a member of the Medical Society of London, then newly founded, and later was elected a member of the Medical Society of Paris.An attack on cow-pox treatment made by Benjamin Moseley, physician to the Chelsea Hospital, brought from Ring a refutation, Then in August 1799, he met Edward Jenner, and they became friends. From 1799 Ring devoted most of his professional life to the cause of vaccination. He had leading medical men in London sign a document acknowledging that cow-pox was a much milder and safer disease than inoculated smallpox. He went to Ringwood in 1808 at the head of a deputation to investigate some supposed failures of vaccination; feeling was running so high that the deputies carried pistols.The British Vaccine Establishment was founded in 1809, later the National Vaccine Establishment and a government department for the distribution of vaccine. Jenner was appointed the first director, and he nominated Ring to act as his principal vaccinator and inspector of stations. Ring was set aside, however, and Jenner resigned his post, which was then filled by James Moore, a brother of Sir John Moore.Ring opened his own vaccinating station, which became popular. He died of apoplexy at his house in New Street, Hanover Square, London, on 7 December 1821.
