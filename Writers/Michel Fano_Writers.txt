Michel Fano (born 9 December 1929) is a French musician, composer, writer, filmmaker, and sound designer. He developed the concept of continuum sonore to describe the potential for a film's soundtrack to interact with its visual content. During the early 1950s, he was part of a generation of composers associated with the Darmstadt School, and was a lifelong friend of Pierre Boulez. From 1962 until 1975, he regularly collaborated with Alain Robbe-Grillet on cinematic projects, creating partitions sonores (or "sound-scores") for five of Robbe-Grillet's films.
