Women, in particular, need to reject any christology that "smacks of sexism and functions to entrench lopsided gender relations."Hinga's 2017 book, African, Christian, Feminist:The Enduring Search for What Matters is a collection of essays that examine her journey from Africa to Silicon Valley, seeking to show the concrete impact of feminist work in religion in areas including HIV/AIDS and violence against women.
