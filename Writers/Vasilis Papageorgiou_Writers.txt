Vasilis Papageorgiou (Greek: Βασίλης Παπαγεωργίου, Thessaloniki, 1955) is a Greek-Swedish writer and translator. Since 1975 he lives in Sweden. He has translated books of numerous writers into Greek, such as W. G. Sebald, Willy Kyrklund, Eva Runefelt, Magnus William-Olsson, Tomas Tranströmer (Collected poems, shortlisted for the Greek National translation prize 2005) and John Ashbery. He has translated into Swedish (with different colleagues) books of Odysseas Elytis, Thanasis Valtinos, Kenneth Koch, W. G. Sebald, all the poems and fragments of Sappho (annotated edition) and an annotated collection with posthumous poems and prose of Konstantinos Kavafis. He has published essays, book reviews and literary texts in Greek, Swedish and British journals. He is a docent of comparative literature and professor of creative writing at Linnaeus University in Sweden.His thesis Euripides’ Medea and Cosmetics is a post-structuralist analysis of the tragedy, in which Euripides, with the help of the radical otherness of Medea, criticises the Greek logos. His monograph on the poetry collection Mjuka mörkret by Eva Runefelt, Panta rei i Mjuka mörkret, and his essay collection Here, and Here: Essays on Affirmation and Tragic Awareness, are a series of critical analyses, which try to follow the use of logos as it exceeds the arbitrariness of logos within an affirmative and tragically aware openness. In his most recent theoretical and literary publications Papageorgiou studies how certain texts turn melancholia (which is generated by the paralysis of logos) into euphoria (which is created by a logos free from the arbitrariness of logos), and vice versa.
