Francisco Izquierdo Ríos (August 29, 1910 – June 30, 1981) was a Peruvian writer and teacher.

About his work
Izquierdo Ríos was one of the most important Peruvian storytellers of the 20th century. Coming from the Peruvian Amazonia, he recreated the landscape of the region and told the stories of everyday people in his writing. His most commonly-used medium was the short story. His work is known for being deceptively passionate, especially when considering how simple his writing was. In addition to short stories, he composed poetry and wrote several essays on literary criticism. Many of his works were aimed at children.

Biography
Izquierdo Ríos was born in Saposoa, which is the capital of Huallaga Province in the high jungle of Peru. His parents, Francisco Izquierdo Saavedra and Silvia Rios Seijas, were indigenous peasants. He had seven brothers. One, Guillermo Izquierdo Rios, also became a writer.
After completing his secondary education at the National School of Moyobamba in 1927, he studied teaching at the National Pedagogical Institute for Boys, graduating in 1930.

In 1943, he was appointed inspector of education in the province of Maynas and after completing his work, he moved to Lima as director of the Night School No. 36 in Callao, where he worked for 21 years (from 1943 to 1964).
He also served as the head of the Department of Folklore in the Ministry of Education. As part of his work, together with José María Arguedas, he published the book Peruvian Myths, Legends, and Tales in 1947.
