Background and education
Kevin Jared Hosein was born in Chaguanas, Trinidad, in 1986.
As a young child, he was not initially interested in reading, but was more into video games, especially those with story-heavy plots. Later on in his childhood, Hosein became deeply interested in books and writing, particularly authors such as Stephen King and Cormac McMarthy. Of Caribbean literature, the 1972 novel No Pain Like This Body, written by Harold “Sonny” Ladoo, had a large influence on Hosein's interest in reading and writing.Due to Literature not being offered as an option at his secondary school, Hosein obtained a degree in Biology and Environmental Studies at the University of West Indies.

Works, awards, and honours
In 2015, Hosein's entry to the Commonwealth Short Story Prize, "The King of Settlement 4", won the Caribbean regional category of the prize. Then in 2018, he won the Commonwealth Short Story Prize, with his work "Passage". His entry won out of 5,200 entries from 48 countries, and he received £5,000 as an award on 2 July 2018, in Cyprus.

Among many of the themes it discusses, nature and the exploitation of such by humans are recurring. The story contains many ecological details that are thanks to his biology and environmental science degree, and the time he has spent on trails in the forest. The first story he entered for the Commonwealth Short Story Prize in 2013, "The Monkey Trap", was featured in Pepperpot: Best New Stories from the Caribbean. It has also been shortlisted for the Small Axe Literary Prize.

It was followed by The Repenters (2016), which was shortlisted for the Bocas Prize and longlisted for the International Dublin Literary Award and the OCM Bocas Prize. His 2018 book, The Beast of Kukuyo, won second place for the Burt Award for Caribbean literature.Hosein's first novel for adults is 2023's Hungry Ghosts, which won pre-publication praise from Hilary Mantel ("a deeply impressive book… and an important one") and Bernardine Evaristo ("An astonishing novel – linguistically gorgeous, narratively propulsive and psychologically profound"), among others. Reviewing it for The Times, Claire Allfree called Hungry Ghosts a "sumptuous, brilliantly written novel".
