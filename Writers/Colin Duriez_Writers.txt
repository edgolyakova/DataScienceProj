Colin Duriez (born 19 July 1947) is a writer on fantasy, especially that of J. R. R. Tolkien.

Life and works
Duriez was born in Derbyshire and spent his early life in Long Eaton, Derbyshire, in a couple of new council estates near Portsmouth and six years in a mining village in South Wales, before moving to the West Midlands. After school he studied for two years at the University of Istanbul, Turkey, before completing his studies at the University of Ulster in Coleraine, Northern Ireland where he read English and philosophy. After a career in editing and journalism in London, interspersed with some teaching, he migrated to Leicester in 1983 to work with a small publisher, IVP, as a commissioning editor. In 2002 he started his own business, InWriting, devoted to writing, editorial services, and some book acquisition for publishers.
Duriez won the Clyde S. Kilby Award in 1994 for his research on the Inklings, the literary group that included Tolkien and C. S. Lewis. He has published many books on Christian literary figures, and other written works, and he has spoken to literary, academic and professional groups.
