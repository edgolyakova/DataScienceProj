Ernir was the son of Snorri Jónsson, a merchant, and Björg G. Kristjánsdóttir, a housewife. He grew up in Reykjavik, graduating in psychology in 1971 from the University of Strasbourg. He received a licence for general medical practice in Iceland in 1988, in Norway in 1993, and license as a specialist in psychiatry in 1994. Ernir worked in Iceland, France and Norway, as a doctor, teacher, and running his own medical practice in the Domus Medica in Iceland.
