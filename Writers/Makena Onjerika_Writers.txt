Career
In July 2018, Makena won the 2018 Caine Prize for African Writing – often described as Africa's leading literary award, for her short story entitled "Fanta Blackcurrant", published in Wasafiri (2017). The Chair of the Caine Prize judging panel, award-winning Ethiopian-American novelist and writer Dinaw Mengestu, announced Makena as the winner of the £10,000 prize at an award dinner. The ceremony was held for the second time in London University's Senate House, in partnership with SOAS and the Centre for African Studies. Mengestu praised the story in his remarks, saying, "the winner of this year’s Caine Prize is as fierce as they come – a narrative forged but not defined by the streets of Nairobi, a story that stands as more than just witness. Makena Onjerika’s 'Fanta Blackcurrant' presides over a grammar and architecture of its own making, one that eschews any trace of sentimentality in favour of a narrative that is haunting in its humour, sorrow and intimacy."Makena is a graduate of the MFA Creative Writing programme at New York University, and has been published in Urban Confusions and Wasifiri. 
She lives in Nairobi, Kenya, and is currently working on a fantasy novel.She founded the Nairobi Fiction Writing Workshop and edited the anthology Digital Bedbugs, composed of the stories from the workshop.
