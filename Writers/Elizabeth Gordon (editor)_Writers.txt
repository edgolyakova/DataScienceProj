She spent five years researching the subject, including 16 months in Japan. The Shibui special issue (August 1960) "caused a sensation".She edited The House Beautiful/AIA Climate Control Project, and wrote several articles on climate control for the magazine.She was married to Carl Norcross, "an authority on town planning." The couple's 1941 residence in Dobbs Ferry, New York, was designed by architect Julius Gregory.
