Peter Karvaš (25 April 1920 in Banská Bystrica − 28 November 1999) was a Slovakian writer.
He was a philosopher, theatre scholar, dramaturg and diplomat. In 1968 he was banned from publishing as a result of the Prague Spring. Karvaš became known above all for his plays, of which the Mitternachtsmesse (Midnight Mass) was also successfully performed in Germany. In addition, there is an equally remarkable prose work and numerous theoretical works in the field of theatre studies and philosophy.
Karvaš died in 1999 in Bratislava at the age of 79.
