In 1517 he was appointed canon to the bishop of Pécs, received a diploma from Louis II that extended his crests, and shortly afterwards Brodericus was made head prelate of Pécs. The Hungarian-Croatian bishop spent most of his time in the chancellery: the most important organ of the Hungarian internal and foreign affairs. He mostly dealt with issues concerning foreign affairs. His series of diplomatic tasks began in 1521, which only ended with his death.In 1521 he became secretary to the king, in 1524 dean cantor at the Esztergom Basilica. He also served as the king's chancellor and the bishop of Srijem. King János Szapolyai nominated Brodericus as Bishop of Pécs in 1536; he became Bishop of Vác in 1538 and served there until his death in 1539. Brodericus participated in several diplomatic missions and wrote an account of the 1526 Battle of Mohács in his 1568 book Clades in campo Mohacz. Eight editions of the book were eventually published.
