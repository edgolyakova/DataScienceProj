Gaughran’s debut historical novel released in 2011 and is based around the South American Wars of Independence and the successful campaign of José de San Martín to liberate Argentina, Chile, and Peru from the Spanish Empire. Mercenary His second historical fiction release in 2014 follows a real historical figure named Lee Christmas - a mercenary who was active during the growth of the banana industry  in Honduras and subsequent U.S. intervention. Mercenary was recommended by Wall Street Journal bestselling author Michael Wallace, and Donald Barker at Reedsy Discovery called it a "story lifted straight out of history."

Cindy Vallar at Historical Novels Review called it, a "tale of an overlooked rebellion, told from the perspective of the streets, with dialogue that is more heard than read and unexpected twists.” References External links David Gaughran Official Site Works by or about David Gaughran in libraries (WorldCat catalog)
