Reviews
A New York Times review in 2001 described him as "a painter who has nailed down the figurative mode, and this accomplishment gives him the license to convey anything he wants, including the grand theme: the elusive meaning of human existence.”A Washington Post review in 2004 added that Frenn is "an artist's artist (as opposed to a critic's artist)." In that same year, in discussing an exhibition of Frenn's works at Darmouth The Lebanon Daily Star newspaper noted that "you might think it would take a lot to upstage an artist like Damien Hirst, but earlier this year Chawky Frenn did so with ease."American art critic Donald Kuspit wrote that "He constructs a spiritual space in which the contemporary public can feel emotionally at home, however troubling the emotions his imagery evokes in them."
Washington Life Magazine described Frenn in 2009 as an "influential metro area visual artist."
