Idriss ibn Muhammad ibn al-Amraoui (Arabic: إدريس بن محمد بن العمراوي), son of the poet Mohammed ibn Idris al-Amrawi was a Moroccan emissary who, in the service of sultan Mohammed IV (1859–1873), visited Paris in 1860 and Spain in 1861. His arrival in France coincided with the death of Napoleon III. He wrote a rihla of that journey called Tuhfat almalik al-aziz bi-mamlakat Bariz. He gives a detailed description of his impressions. Beside prose works Al-Amraoui has also left an important diwan.
