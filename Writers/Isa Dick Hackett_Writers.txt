Hackett stated that Price aggressively asked her for sex in a taxi, which was the first time they had met, repeatedly telling her "You will love my dick" even though she assertively told him she was not interested, was a lesbian, and had a wife and children. Michael Paull, a top executive at Amazon, was in the taxi with them at the time. Later that night, Price yelled "Anal sex!" into Hackett's ear while she was in a conversation with other Amazon executives. Price was fired after an internal investigation by Amazon.
