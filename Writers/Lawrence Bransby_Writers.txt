Lawrence Bransby (born 1951) is a South African born author of eleven books, such as Downstreet and Lifeblood Earthblood which highlighted the racial prejudice of individuals towards people of many different races and showed that it need not be the case. It also highlighted the political turmoil of a nation undergoing change through democratic reform into a more sociocratic regime. Several more of his books are available on Amazon.com and other similar websites. Downstreet was the first of several books Lawrence Bransby wrote and won the MER Prize in South Africa.Each of the books he wrote during the late 80's and early nineties were inspiring to the youthful pupils under his English tutelage at Ixopo High School. Notably, Cy Edmondson, who was one of his students, authored a book detailing his personal troubles and how he overcame them in a book entitled "I Can".
