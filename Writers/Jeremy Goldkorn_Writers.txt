Danwei was blocked in mainland China in 2009.In early 2013, Goldkorn sold Danwei to the Financial Times.Goldkorn has spoken frequently about Chinese media and Internet culture, including at the University of Sydney and Columbia Law School, and in interviews with Frontline, the Australia Network and the Asia Society.
