Robert Lomas is a British writer, physicist and business studies academic. He writes primarily about the history of Freemasonry as well as the Neolithic period, ancient engineering, and archaeoastronomy.

Career
Lomas gained a First Class Honours degree in Electronic Engineering from the University of Salford before being awarded a PhD for his research into solid state physics and crystalline structures. From here he went on to work on electronic weapons systems and emergency services command and control systems.He lectured on Information Systems at the University of Bradford's School of Management. According to his website, Lomas is a regular supporter of the Orkney International Science Festival, having lectured there, chaired sessions, and taken part in the school's support sessions over a period of eight years.Outside of his academic specialities, Lomas has written on various topics, such as the Neolithic period, archaeoastronomy, ancient mysteries, stone monuments, and megaliths, and on astronomical and astrological topics, as well as the history, ritual, and spiritual journey of Freemasonry.
Elements of his work have been described as "hoaxes" by members of the Freemasonry community. For example, the redaction of a document called "The Masonic Testament" by Lomas and co-author Christopher Knight, in their Book of Hiram (2003), from fragments of old manuscripts and ritual, has been described as "An invention by the highly imaginative authors ... which has no historical validity". A review from The Square, reprinted on Lomas' website states that Turning the Hiram Key "should be viewed as an invitation to think, rather than a prescriptive statement".
