His book Mim (1999)  absorbed various creative motifs, including reflections on the poet's and his poetry's place and impressions of his trip to the Soviet Union a decade before in October 1989. Criticism. Evaluation of creativity Russian literary critic and researcher Anna Pogadaeva comments on the style of Ahmad Kamal's writing, stating that: "His poems are musical, full of inner rhythm, he perfectly uses all the possibilities of the Malay language, extracting from it sometimes tender and sincere, sometimes ecstatic and explosive sounds, filling each line with movement and turning each verse into a living organism. The combination of feelings and visions permeated with a passionate love for God is the inexhaustible source of the poet's creative inspiration: it is a fusion of sounding image and music, avant-gardism and traditional Sufi motifs, as well as a rhythmic series of folklore forms."
