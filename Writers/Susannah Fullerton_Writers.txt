Biography
Born in Edmonton, Alberta, in 1960, Fullerton moved with her family to New Zealand while still young. She was first introduced to Jane Austen when she was ten and her mother read Pride and Prejudice to her. Fullerton has become a popular literary lecturer in Australia. She has lectured at the Art Gallery of NSW, the State Library of New South Wales, at libraries, schools and clubs. She is a registered speaker for Australia Decorative and Fine Arts Societies (ADFAS). In the 2017 Queen's Birthday Honours List she received an Order of Australia Medal of the Order (OAM) for Services to Literature. She has said Austen's writing remains popular because it "is still so relevant today".She was involved in getting the statue of Charles Dickens back into Centennial Park, New South Wales and, along with Miriam Margolyes, spoke at the unveiling of that statue.

Writing
Fullerton's book, Jane Austen and Crime (2004), explores Austen's childhood fascination with crime and the way that crime and punishment affected her life. Brief Encounters (2009) is a collection of writers' narratives of their travels through early colonized Australia, of which the Hectate's Australian Women's Book Review said was only lacking in women's voices.Fullerton's 2013 book, Celebrating Pride and Prejudice, describes the history and contemporary reception of Austen's book Pride and Prejudice. Celebrating Pride and Prejudice also describes spin-offs of the original book and the reasons why Elizabeth Bennet and Mr. Darcy are such beloved characters. Star Tribune praised the book for its use of illustrations which were "as much fun as the text." The Sydney Morning Herald called Celebrating Pride and Prejudice "an intelligent and generous companion to Pride and Prejudice: its author and her era, characters, language, reception, adaptions, industry."
