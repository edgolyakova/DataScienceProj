Moncef Chelli (Arabic: منصف شيلي), (11 February 1936 in Tunis – 18 March 1994 in Paris), was a Franco-Tunisian philosopher and writer. Biography He arrived in France after completing secondary school at Sadiki College in Tunis to begin higher studies in philosophy at the Sorbonne, as well as Arabic and mathematics. He was awarded the rank of docteur d'État of letters and humanities in 1979. He was fluent in six languages (French, English, Spanish, Arabic, Latin and Ancient Greek) and equally competent at mathematics, geometry and studying the theory of relativity which strongly inspired his philosophical writings. He produced, notably, a translation of Rene Descartes' Rules for the Direction of the Mind into Arabic for UNESCO. In 1983 he presided over a seminar of the world congress for philosophy in Montreal, Quebec, Canada. He was the author of numerous books. His chief and final work, Le Mythe de cristal, published posthumously, dealt with the theory of cultural relativity, on which he had worked all his life, and attempted to explain the reasons for the contemporary supremacy of the West and the reasons for its confrontation with the East.
