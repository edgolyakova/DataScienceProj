István Fekete (25 January 1900, Gölle, Austria-Hungary  – 23 June 1970, Budapest, Hungary) was a Hungarian writer. He wrote several youth novels and animal stories.

He is perhaps best known for his youth novel Tüskevár ("Thorn Castle", 1957), about two city boys' summer holiday at the corner of Lake Balaton and Zala River, their experiences, adventures, contact with Nature in its genuine form. They are helped by an old man on their gradual journey into manhood.
