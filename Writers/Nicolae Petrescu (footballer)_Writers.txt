Nicolae "Nicky" Petrescu (2 April 1913 – 1991) was a Romanian professional footballer and football manager.

Playing career
Nicolae Petrescu was born on 2 April 1913 in Bucharest, Romania and spent his entire playing career at local club Juventus, making his debut for the club in the last round of the 1930–31 București championship when coach Emerich Vogl used him the whole game in a 9–0 victory against Sportul Studențesc București. In the following years, Petrescu started to play more often, consolidating his place in the first 11 of the team, helping it gain promotion to Divizia A by the end of the 1932–33 season, his style of play being praised by the Gazeta Sporturilor newspaper after a 3–2 victory in front of Sportul Studențesc:"Insistent attacks started from the ranks of The Black and Whites (Sportul) are hardly stopped by the defense of The Red and Blues (Juventus). Petrescu is at ease, moving like a swashbuckler among his opponents, whom he regularly deprives of the ball". In the first round of the following season, he made his Divizia A debut on 17 September 1933 when coach Ladislau Csillag used him in all the minutes of a 3–1 away victory in front of Ripensia Timișoara. He scored his first and only goal of his career in the eight-finals of the 1935–36 Cupa României in a 3–1 victory against Maccabi București, Juventus managing to reach the semi-finals of that edition, a performance which was repeated in the following season. In the last years of his career, Petrescu played more rarely and the team's results were poorer season after season, eventually relegating by the end of the 1939–40 season but he stayed with the club helping it promote after one season by contributing with 14 appearances, however he did not get to play again in Divizia A as the championship was interrupted because of World War II, thus ending his playing career in which he gained a total of 107 Divizia A appearances and 16 matches with one goal scored in Cupa României.
