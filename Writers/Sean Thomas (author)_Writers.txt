Sean Thomas is a British journalist and author.  Born in Devon, England, he studied Philosophy at University College London. As a journalist he has written for The Times, The Daily Mail, The Spectator and The Guardian, and many other journals, chiefly on travel, politics and art. He has written, as a journalist, of his spectacularly troubled early life - as a child and young man. 
As a novelist he writes under multiple names. As Tom Knox, he specialises in archaeological and religious thrillers.  He has also published erotic fiction under the pseudonym A J Molloy. More recently he has written novels under the pen name S K Tremayne.

Writing career
His first Tom Knox thriller, The Genesis Secret, focuses on the Neolithic archaeological site known as Göbekli Tepe in Turkey, which Thomas visited as a journalist in 2006. The book speculates on the genetic and sociological origins of Christianity, Judaism and Islam, with particular attention to the trait of sacrifice. Noteworthy for several exceptionally gruesome episodes, it was an international bestseller, and has so far been translated into 21 languages.  The novel provoked controversy when the German Archaeology Institute complained that both a newspaper article and the book were based on "a falsified version of an interview with [chief archaeologist] Klaus Schmidt", which they argued constituted "a distortion of the scientific work of the German Archaeological Institute". Thomas has since returned to the Göbekli Tepe site, and its new associated sites - the ‘Taş Tepeler’ - summarizing his findings in a widely read article in The Spectator in 2022
His second Tom Knox thriller, The Marks of Cain was published in 2010. Centring on the little-known Cagot community who lived in the Basque Country, and the troubled history of the German empire in Namibia, it too was an international bestseller. In Germany, the ebook version, published under the title Cagot, was notable for its experimental use of interactivity and alternate reality games.A third book, titled Bible of the Dead (or The Lost Goddess outside the United Kingdom) was published in March 2011 in the UK, and in the US in February 2012,and focuses on the Khmer Rouge, while taking in the cave paintings of France, and modern Chinese Communism. More recently, Thomas has returned to Cambodia and written on the inspiration for this novel, when he attended the 2009 UN trial of Khmer Rouge apparatchik, Comrade Duch.In 2012, without revealing his identity, he published an "erotic novel" The Story of X, about a young female American student, who falls in love with a Neapolitan aristocrat, who introduces her to a secret, eroticised cult based on the ancient Greco-Roman Mysteries. The book was written under the name A J Molloy, and was translated into a dozen languages. It was a particular bestseller in South Korea.
In 2015, under the pseudonym S K Tremayne, Thomas published a novel called  The Ice Twins, about a London couple who lose a child, one of identical twins, and thereafter move to a remote island in Scotland. At this point the parents begin to suspect they have misidentified the surviving child. The Ice Twins became a Sunday Times Top Ten Bestseller in February 2015.The same novel, translated as IJstweeling, went into the Dutch top ten bestseller list, following its publication in the Netherlands in March 2015. In May 2015, under the title Eisige Schwestern, the same book entered the Spiegel bestseller list, in Germany; the book went on to spend fifteen weeks in the German top ten. In September 2015, The Ice Twins, in paperback form, became a number one Sunday Times bestseller in the UK. As of December 2016, The Ice Twins has been translated into 29 languages, and has been a bestseller in various territories: including Brazil, France, Denmark, Finland and Taiwan.
His second S K Tremayne novel, The Fire Child, became a top ten bestseller in Germany in January 2017, under the title Stiefkind. The novel entered the UK's Sunday Times bestseller top ten in February 2017. A third novel, Just Before I Died, was published in August 2018.
In January 2019, The Ice Twins became a Nielsen Silver Award winner, for selling 250,000 copies in the UK.

He has also described long struggles with drug addiction, especially heroin.
