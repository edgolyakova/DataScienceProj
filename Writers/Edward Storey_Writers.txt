Edward Storey (28 February 1930 – 18 November 2018), was an English poet, dramatist and non-fiction writer. He was born at Whittlesey, part of the Isle of Ely in Cambridgeshire. The Fens inspired much of his work.

Early career
Before becoming a full-time writer in the late 1960s, Storey completed National Service and worked in adult education for the Peterborough City Education Authority and the Workers' Educational Association (WEA). His first poetry volume (North Bank Night) appeared in 1969 in the Phoenix Living Poets series.In an early work, Portrait of the Fen Country (1971), Storey reflected on his childhood understanding of the world as shaped by his Fenland experience. In Fen Boy First (1992), published by Robert Hale Ltd, he gave an account of growing up in Whittlesey and in Fen Country Christmas (1995) he collected a number of stories, legends and fenland superstitions. He was a founder member of the John Clare Society and the literature panel of the Eastern Arts Association.

Wales
Storey moved to Wales in 1999. For many years he chaired the Friends of St Michael's, the church next to his home in Discoed, engaged in fundraising to restore the building and support other arts events. New poetry collections, inspired by the local border country and other sources, were self-published by the Friends of St Michael's. Seeing the Light (Leverett Press, 2015) is one of these.
Edward Storey died at his home in Discoed early on the morning of 18 November 2018. The funeral service was held at St Michaels on 5 December.

Appreciation
"A deeply meditative poet who sees in nature a mirror for the human condition and sensibility.. these are beautifully crafted poems that exist because they have to." (The Poetry Quarterly Review)
"You won't find a poet who can quite do what Storey does." (Envoi)
"Effortless in its voice, language and poetic form, and in its relationship with the reader... never slight nor dependent on conventional sentiment, but marked by grace or gravitas." (Ambit)
