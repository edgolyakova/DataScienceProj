Raúl Nuñez (1946/47-1996) was an Argentine writer. He was born in Buenos Aires in 1946, and settled in Barcelona in 1971 where he lived until 1988. Many of his novels were set against the backdrop of Barcelona's nightlife. These include titles such as Derrama whisky sobre tu amigo muerto, People, Sinatra, and La rubia del bar. Some of his books were turned into movies, for example, Francesc Betriu directed the movie version of Sinatra, while La rubia del bar was directed by Ventura Pons. From 1990 onwards, he wrote for the Valencia journal Turia, continuing until his death in that city in 1996.
