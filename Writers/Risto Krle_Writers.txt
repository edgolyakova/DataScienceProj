Risto Krle (Macedonian: Ристо Крле, pronounced [ri'stɔ kr̩'le]; September 3, 1900 – October 29, 1975) (born in Struga, present-day North Macedonia during the Ottoman Empire) was a Macedonian playwright and the son of a shoe maker. Many interruptions made his schooling difficult. As a teenager he enrolled in the army where he served until he inherited his father's profession and succeeded as a shoe maker. Many of his plays were written throughout the Second World War and are set preceding or during the First and Second Balkan Wars.
