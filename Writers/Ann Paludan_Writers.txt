Ann Elizabeth Paludan (née Murray; 1928–2014) was a British author of several books on Chinese history, sculpture and architecture. Biography Ann Paludan was one of two daughters of Pauline Mary (née Newton) and Basil Murray.

After graduating she worked as a British diplomat, marrying John Ernest Powell-Jones in December 1949 and starting a life abroad in 1949.Her son, Sir Mark Jones, was born on 5 February 1951; he was an art historian and museum director and has been Master of St Cross College, Oxford since 2011.Janus Paludan (1920–2004), a Danish diplomat, had served as Danish Ambassador to the Congo 1962–1965 and to Brazil 1968–1972, and he and Ann married before he took up the post of Danish Ambassador to China in 1972.
