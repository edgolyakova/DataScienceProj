Controversial views Mananzan is known for being feminist. She was one of the Catholics who supported the RH Bill, which guarantees access to contraception, fertility control, sexual education, and maternal care. The bill was signed by President Benigno Aquino III. I am a nun but I am for the reproductive health law, because I'm a woman. And I think the bishops overreacted. A lot of things they say that [are] in the bill is not true, it is not for abortion. There are 3 places in the law that say abortion is illegal in the Philippines so you cannot say that bill is for abortion. It is not. They are deprived of participation in the major decision-making processes and are denied full ministry in the Church. I am very sorry that I will never see in my lifetime the full ministry given to women in the Catholic Church. She was also known for her support for SOGIE Equality Bill, known as Equality Bill or Anti-Discrimination Bill (ADB). I don't see that this bill is giving any special right to this group. They are just saying that the rights of everybody should also be applied to them, as a religious woman I believe in the respect, compassion, and reverence for all persons because I believe they were all made in the image and likeness of God. Therefore, it is really the one that is discriminated against that is the focus of our attention, even if we are really against the discrimination of anybody, sometimes you have to focus on groups of people that are actually suffering discrimination and violence. Both bills were opposed by the Catholic Bishops' Conference of the Philippines.
