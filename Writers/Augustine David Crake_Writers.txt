Augustine David Crake (1836–1890) was an English cleric and author, known for devotional works, and for juvenile historical fiction that has been compared to the books of John Mason Neale.

Life
The eldest son of Jesse Crake, he was born on 1 October 1836 at Chalgrove, Oxfordshire, where his father kept a middle-class school. Leaving the Calvinism in which he had been brought up, he was baptised into the Church of England in 1858. Working as a teacher, he took a degree at London University (matriculated 1862, B.A. 1864).Crake was ordained deacon by Bishop Samuel Wilberforce in 1865, and was appointed second master and chaplain of the Church of England middle-class school of All Saints', Bloxham, near Banbury, a position which he kept from 1865 to 1878. He was senior curate of St. Michael's, Swanmore in the Isle of Wight, 1878–9, and vicar of St. Peter's, Havenstreet from 1879 to 1885, when he made an exchange and became vicar of Cholsey, near Wallingford. He was chaplain at Moulsford Asylum, 1885–6.At Cholsey, Crake was beginning to gather some pupils round him for tuition, but he died on 18 January 1890, at the age of 53. He was buried in Cholsey graveyard on 23 January when many of his former Bloxham pupils followed his remains to the grave.
