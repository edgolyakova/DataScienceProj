He also had another cottage as a literary retreat as he continued to write books and contribute to periodicals. His Lift-Luck on Southern Roads is thought to be the earliest published account of hitchhiking.Edwardes wrote a novel Tansy about a shepherdess on the Sussex Downs. This was made into a silent film in 1921, directed by Cecil Hepworth, also titled Tansy. Military service Edwardes was already an established writer and in his late forties at the outbreak of war.

Tickner himself died on 29 December 1944 and was buried in St Mary's Church in Burpham.John Cowper Powys was a friend and neighbour in Burpham. He wrote: "Edwardes was a man of meticulous nicety in his literary art. I recollect being confounded by the elaborate craftsmanship with which he laboured; pondering on words, taking words up, as it were, and laying them down, just as he did with the materials of his hives!" Powys especially "liked the toughwood texture of his bodily presence ... His long nose, his opaque, ivory-parchment skin, his tree-root neck, his shy, nervous, wild-animal brown eyes ... He possessed that grave, solid, imperturbable reserve, that stiff pride, mixed with disarming spasms of humility, that have characterized so many of the old-fashioned interpreters of English piety."
