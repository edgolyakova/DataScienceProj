This is a description from the report of the Al-Multaqa Prize Jury: "The stories in Diaa Jubaili's collection vary in length from the very short to very long. They deal with the subjects of war by moving between reality and fantasy. With a sarcasm-laced narrative, he transforms the subject of war into a major introspective exercise on the significance of absurdity, nihilism, and a genuine desire to overcome the futility of death. The stories provide a reflection on the three wars of Iraq: the Iran-Iraq war, the 1991 Gulf War, and the 2003 American invasion, which set off a wave of extremism that is choking the country to this day."
