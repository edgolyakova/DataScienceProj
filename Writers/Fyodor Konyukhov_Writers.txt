Supposedly Konyukhov attended a nautical school in Odessa and another in Leningrad earning a specialty in polar navigation. Supposedly he worked as a professional navigator and marine engineer. He served 3 years in the Soviet Navy. There is a legend that he was stationed in a Kaliningrad guardhouse with the Baltic Fleet when he volunteered for a 2.5 year tour of duty as a Soviet Marine sailing across the South China Sea as special forces delivering munitions to the Viet Cong during the Vietnam War.  After his service in the Soviet Armed Forces, he left behind the terrible realities of war and completed a vocational arts school in Bobruisk which enabled him to become a successful painter and sculptor.

Feats
Konyukhov is the only person to have reached such extreme points of the planet as the North Pole (three times), the South Pole, the Pole of Inaccessibility in the Arctic Ocean and the top of Mount Everest (twice) and also sailed around the world via Cape Horn 4 times.

Sailing
In November 2000, Konyukhov was engaged in the French solo non-stop round the world yacht race "Vendée Globe" 2000-2001 (at first 24 skippers, then 15 rated) on the "Open 60" type "Modern University for the Humanities" yacht. Due to technical breakdown, Fyodor stopped at Sydney (AUS) and so was forfeited from the race. In 2020 Konyukhov remains the only Russian sailor to compete in this race.In May 2008, Konyukhov completed a solo circumnavigation of Antarctica in a sailboat, becoming the first person to do so. His attempt began on 26 January 2008 and took 102 days in total, with his route falling entirely between the 45th and 60th parallels south.

Rowing
Konyukhov has set world records, notably crossing the Atlantic Ocean in a row-boat URALAZ in 46 days, the best 24-hour distance in the same boat (110 miles).

Ballooning
On 23 July 2016, Konyukhov became the second person to circumnavigate the world in a hybrid hot-air helium balloon. American Steve Fossett is the only other person to have completed the feat, having done so in 2002 on his sixth attempt. Konyukhov took "just over 11 days", as opposed to Fossett's 13 days.Konyukhov announced his intention to challenge Fossett's record in September 2015, although the idea had "first captured [his] imagination in 1992". The balloon he used, named the Morton, was specially constructed by Cameron Balloons in Bristol, England, and had a height of 60 metres (200 ft) and a volume of 15,500 cubic metres (20,300 cu yd). The balloon's non-pressurised gondola was made of carbon fibre and measured roughly 2 metres (6.6 ft) wide and 2 metres (6.6 ft) tall, containing Konyukhov's bed, food, water, oxygen, and first-aid supplies, as well as navigation and communication equipment.The attempt began in Northam, Western Australia, 96 kilometres (60 mi) north-east of Perth, on 12 July 2016. He and his team had arrived in Australia in June, but experienced several delays due to weather and the failure of equipment to arrive on time. After launching, Konyukhov flew east across Australia and the South Pacific Ocean to South America, where he passed through Chile, Argentina, Uruguay, and the southern tip of Brazil. He then flew across the South Atlantic, the southern Indian Ocean, and the Southern Ocean before eventually landing again in Bonnie Rock, Western Australia, completing his circumnavigation. Konyukhov's planned route was 33,000 kilometres (21,000 mi), but an unexpected southerly deviation (which took him to the Antarctic Circle) extended his flight to 34,000 kilometres (21,000 mi).He set a new round-the world time of 272h 11m, as of 17 September 2016 subject to official confirmation. He described his experience in a newspaper article.In November 2019 he said he would travel in a balloon into the stratosphere.
