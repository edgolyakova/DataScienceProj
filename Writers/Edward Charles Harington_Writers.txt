Edward Harington by his wife, Frances, daughter of John Boote of Fifield House, Oxfordshire; Sir Edward Harington was his grandfather.

He resigned his incumbency, and concentrated on diocesan work, especially education. He managed consensus in establishing the Diocesan Training College, taught there, and contributed to its endowments. In 1856 he became a canon residentiary of Exeter, spending no less than £15,000 on the repairs of the fabric, and £1,000 in providing seats in the nave. He also acted as subdean.Harington was shy and considered somewhat eccentric, residing at first with his sisters and then alone. He attended the turning of the first sod of every new railway in England, and collected a good library. On 4 July 1881 he was attacked by apoplexy while attending a meeting at the Exeter Guildhall for the Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals, and died on the 14th of the month. He was buried with his Haringtom ancestors at Kelston.
