Shahnon's father had been previously working as a staff at the surveyor department, then a postman until the Second World War when the British forces hired him as a clandestine spy.He and one sibling of his were able to attend their studies at the Sultan Abdul Hamid College in Alor Setar through financial aid provided by the intelligence services as a reward to their father for his services - amidst common fears by most villagers that their children might embrace Christianity if they were educated in such schools at that time. After graduating from the school in 1954, he worked as a teacher in an English school in Kuala Terengganu. He served in the army from 1955 to 1956.

Literary career The first works were published in 1950s - he began his writing as an interpreter and a writer of short stories. In 1965, he made his debut as a novelist, releasing the novel Rentong ("Till Ashes"), a drama of characters taking place in a Malay village. The different types of attitude to reality are revealed and demonstrated by its narrative and main characters.Shahnon published several highly topical "urban" novels since. "Minister" (1967) paid tribute to Malay nationalism. His next novel, one of his most famous ones, Ranjau Sepanjang Jalan ("No Harvest but a Thorn", 1966) tells about a peasant family fighting not for life, but for death with nature in the struggle for existence; Srengenge (1973)—which won the Malaysian Novel of the Year in 1974—portrays a village enthusiast and reformer defeated by the ancient, pagan-based feelings and sentiments of his fellow countrymen; "Seluang Menodak Baung” (How the smalls defeated an elephant, 1978), reveals the complex process of peasant consciousness awakening in the course of the struggle for land distinguished by a sharp social orientation, psychological reliability and a wonderful style; and the "Lamunan Puitis" ("Poetic Thinking", 2003) trilogy among others. Some of his works were inspired by religious motives, and several novels are written in the genre of caustic satire on the leadership of the country: Shit (1998); Maha Maha ("Great Worlds", 1999); Muntah ("Nausea", 2000).
