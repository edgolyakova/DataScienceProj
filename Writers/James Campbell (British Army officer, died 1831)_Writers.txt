Sir James Campbell (né Callander) (8 October 1745 – 21 May 1831) was a Scottish officer of the British Army, and author of Memoirs of Sir James Campbell of Ardkinglas, written by Himself. Until 1810 he was known as James Callander. While not a baronet, as he claimed, he used the title "Sir". Campbell was 5th Laird of Craigforth and 15th Laird of Ardkinglas. Early life Campbell was the eldest son of John Callander of Craigforth, by his wife Mary, daughter of Sir James Livingston of Glentirran and Dalderse, he was born at Ardkinglas Castle on 21 October (O.S.) 1745. James was educated at Edinburgh High School and under a private tutor. Career In 1759 James Callander, as he then was, joined the 51st regiment as ensign, and served in the Seven Years' War. After 1763 he was in Ireland and Minorca, returning to Scotland in 1789. He ran into financial troubles, and his cousin Sir Alexander Livingston-Campbell of Ardkinglas had him imprisoned for debt, as he believed that Callander had not voted for him in the election and had voted for Callander's friend Sir Thomas Dundas. In fact, James Callander had voted for his cousin.Taking work abroad, under Sir John Acton, 6th Baronet, Callander was inspector-general of troops at Naples. At the request of Lord Nelson, Callander claimed, he went to the Ionian Islands to confirm the inhabitants in their attachment to the English cause. This authority was thought by some to be fictitious, however. He remained there till the Peace of Amiens in 1802.On succeeding in 1810 to the estate of his cousin Sir Alexander Livingston-Campbell of Ardkinglas, Callander adopted the name of Campbell. He also used the title of baronet to which he was not entitled, the Campbell baronetcy of 1679 having terminated with his cousin's death in 1752.  However, his claim to the Livingston baronetcy of 1685 was legitimate, as it was merely dormant. Personal life Campbell was four times married and left a large family. His first wife was Catherine Forbes, the youngest daughter of George Forbes, Esq. of Hitchener Hall, Surrey, they were married in 1769 in Geneva. Before her death in 1771, they were the parents of: George Callander (1770–1824), who married Elizabeth-Crompton Erskine, eldest daughter of Lord Advocate Hon.

George Dashwood; after his death she married Richard Magenis, MP for Enniskillen.In 1777, he married his third wife, Lady Elizabeth MacDonnell, the daughter of Alexander MacDonnell, 5th Earl of Antrim.

Relationship with Sassen When resident in Paris, Campbell made the acquaintance of a French woman, Lina Talina Sassen. Being detained by the order of Napoleon, he supposedly sent her as his commissioner to Scotland, designating her in the power of attorney with which he furnished her as his "beloved wife". On his return to Scotland he declined to recognise the relationship, and she raised an action against him in the court of session. Although the marriage was found not proven, she was awarded a sum of £300. per annum. On appeal to the House of Lords the award was withheld, and Sassen continued to bring legal actions against him, being allowed to sue in formâ pauperis. A daughter had been born to them, around 1813.
