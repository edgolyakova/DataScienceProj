Lore de Angeles (1951-) is an author, psychic and knowledge holder. Of Briton, Alban, Gaeilge and Breizh heritage, de Angeles' ancestry is a direct line to Caradoc (Caratacus) ap Cunobelinus. They are the author of over 15 books on subjects ranging from Priteni lore and curation (see Annals of Tacitus), to witchcraft, poetry, mysticism and speculative fiction. They are an author and film-maker, writing and directing both stage/street productions and short film. De Angeles was sold under a church and state policy of the clean break closed adoption practices, rescinded in recent years as a result of Prime Minister Julia Gillard's National Apology For Forced Adoptions of 2013, and the admission of the Catholic Church for the same violation. Career De Angeles' first child was born in 1972 and, with no known government assistance for a single parent they became involved, within a year, with the fledgling computer industry in Sydney and, through her work with Harper & Row she met author and editor Nevill Drury, who was to launch her career as an author several years later. By 1979 de Angeles was running a coven of several people, reading tarot full-time and had begun public teaching and lectures relating to her magical practice and mysticism, specifically at the New Awareness Centre, and the inaugural Mind, Body and Spirit Festival in a shamanic-style workshop that included Nevill Drury. Ly wrote several articles for Nexus Magazine and their first book, The Way of the Goddess, was published through Unity/Prism, UK, in 1987. This was followed, in 1991, by The Way of Merlyn. Both books were imprints of Drury's own niche publishing company, Prism, in Dorset, England. Both titles were published under another surname. De Angeles had her last name changed legally, whilst continuing to seek her true identity, in 1997. They began to gain answers to blood family, through PARC, in 2001. Writing and production For several years de Angeles has facilitated public gatherings, called Rivers in the Skin, both nationally and internationally, based on their book Priteni.
