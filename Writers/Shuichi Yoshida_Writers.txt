Shūichi Yoshida (吉田 修一, Yoshida Shūichi, born 14 September 1968) is a Japanese novelist.

Biography
Shūichi Yoshida was born in Nagasaki, and studied Business Administration at Hosei University. He won the Bungakukai Prize for New Writers in 1997 for his story "Saigo no Musuko", and the Akutagawa Prize in 2002 (the fifth time he'd been nominated for the prize) for "Park Life". In 2002 he also won the Yamamoto Shūgorō Prize for Parade, and for winning both literary and popular prizes Yoshida was seen as a crossover writer, like Amy Yamada or Masahiko Shimada.  In 2003 he wrote lyrics for the song "Great Escape" on Tomoyasu Hotei's album, 'Doberman'.  His 2007 novel, Akunin, won the Osaragi Jiro Prize and the Mainichi Publishing Culture Award, and was adapted into an award-winning 2010 film by Lee Sang-il. Another novel, Taiyo wa Ugokanai has been made into a 2020 film.
