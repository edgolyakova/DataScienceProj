Christoph Beat Graber (*1960) is a Swiss legal scholar and professor of legal sociology with particular focus on media law at the University of Zurich since 2015. He was previously a founding member of the Faculty of Law at the University of Lucerne and a consultant to various Swiss federal offices and the OECD on communication, cultural and copyright law issues.

Life
His parents' work as hoteliers brought Christoph Beat Graber to St. Moritz in his childhood. After completing the Swiss Matura at the Lyceum Alpinum in the neighboring Zuoz, he studied law at the Universities of Bern and St. Gallen and was admitted to the bar in 1989. 
Thanks to research grants from the Swiss National Science Foundation and the Swiss Federal Department of Home Affairs, Graber subsequently completed his doctoral studies at the European University Institute (EUI) in Florence, where he was able to work closely with Gunther Teubner, among others, and thus further deepen his understanding of Niklas Luhmann's systems theory. He defended his doctoral thesis about the interferences of art and economy from a legal perspective in 1993 as a PhD, before it was published by the Nomos Publishing House in 1994. 
Back at the University of Bern, Christoph Beat Graber habilitated in 2002 on the topic of trade and culture in the audiovisual law of the World Trade Organization. The habilitation thesis, published by Stämpfli, examines the field of tension between international law, economics and cultural policy from an interdisciplinary point of view - a method typically characterizing Graber's work.

After working as a senior research and teaching assistant and lecturer at the University of Bern, Graber became a full professor at the Faculty of Law of the University of Lucerne as a founding member.

Graber is also a member of the executive committee of the Executive Master in Art Market Studies at the University of Zurich.In the context of his interdisciplinary and international research, Christoph Beat Graber has been a Visiting Professor and Scholar at Georgetown University Law Center, at the Institute of International Economic Law of the University of Wollongong and at the Center for the Study of Law at the University of California, Berkeley. From 2016 to 2021, he was a Faculty Associate at the Berkman Klein Center for Internet and Society at Harvard University.In 2023, he returned to Florence as a Fernand Braudel Senior Fellow at the European University Institute. As part of the award, he will participate in the research project "Towards an Institutionalization of Net Neutrality as a Fundamental Right? Prospects of Societal Constitutionalism in the Digital Society".In addition to his academic activities, he has held positions as a consultant to Swiss federal offices and the OECD and as the Executive Director of the Independent Complaints Authority for Radio and Television (UBI). For the duration of two election periods, Graber served as an (independent) member of the Federal Arbitration Commission for the utilization of Copyrights and Related Rights (EschK), elected by the Swiss Federal Council.
