The Hollywood Reporter wrote that Anne Hathaway had been tentatively cast in a movie version of the book.Several of her young adult novels revolve around topical events.  The primary characters of Hope and Other Punchlines are both deeply affected by being born around the time of the terrorist attacks on September 11, 2001.
