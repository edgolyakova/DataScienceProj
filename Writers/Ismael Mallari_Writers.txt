Opinions
In his The Filipino IN English: A Critical Study with Anthology of Representative Essays (1912–1941), Prof. Leopoldo Yabes of the University of the Philippines says: "While he (Mallari) could not be ranked among the abler critics of the older school, he was conceded by a number of informed persons to be the best writer on problems of Architecture and city planning. He wrote on Architecture with the understanding and skill of a truly artistic temperament." Another noted literature, Puro Santillan Castrence, has this to say "One of the country’s most reliable essayist in English . . . Mallari’s forte in his essays was in his use of simple words neatly and economically. He wrote poems, too."
