He attended primary and secondary schools there and started to study architecture at the Czech Technical University in Prague.

Margolius is an author of numerous articles and books on art, architecture, automobiles, design and history.In 2016 Margolius suggested to the Prague Council for a street to be named ‘Obětí totality’ (Víctims of totalitarianism) which was realised in February 2018 by naming in such a way the alley adjacent to the Memorial to the Victims of Communism at Újezd, Malá Strana.
