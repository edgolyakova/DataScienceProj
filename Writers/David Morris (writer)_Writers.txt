David Morris is an American author. He is a founder and distinguished fellow of the Institute for Local Self-Reliance (ILSR).

Institute for Local Self-Reliance
In 1974, David Morris joined with two other urban innovators, waste management specialist Neil Seldman and urban agriculture activist Gil Friend to found the Institute for Local Self-Reliance Located in the Adams Morgan neighborhood of D.C. The founders’ experiments included growing sprouts and worms in the basement and tomatoes in the rooftop greenhouse, installing the neighborhood's, and perhaps the city's, first solar hot water system and compost toilet.
Morris's additional experience with earlier neighborhood innovators provided the background for Neighborhood Power: The New Localism, Dr. Morris's 1975 book, written with Karl Hess.
ILSR became a resource for local, state and national efforts in alternative energy waste management, agriculture and other areas that demonstrated the ability of localities to capture their local wealth for local production and consumption
