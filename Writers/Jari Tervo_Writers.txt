Jari Tervo (born 2 February 1959) is a Finnish author. He is a major name in current Finnish literature.
He writes traditional plot-driven prose, ranging from humorous (Poliisin poika) to a detective story (Myyr채). His works often include autobiographical elements; for example, Kallellaan is a diary, and Minun sukuni tarina has a protagonist who is the author himself, all but in name.
Despite his renown in Finland, only one of his novels have been translated into English: Among the Saints (Pyhiesi Yhteyteen) in 2014.
He was also one of the team captains on Finnish TV's version of Have I Got News For You, Uutisvuoto, from the beginning of the show in 1998 until 2017.
