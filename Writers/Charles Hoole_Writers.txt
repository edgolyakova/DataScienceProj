Charles Hoole (1610–1667) was an English cleric and educational writer. He produced a visually-improved English translation of the Orbis Pictus of Comenius, a year after its original publication in 1658.

Life
The son of Charles Hoole of Wakefield in Yorkshire, he was born there. He was educated at Wakefield free school, and at Lincoln College, Oxford, where he proceeded B.A. on 12 June 1634 and M.A. on 7 July 1636. Robert Sanderson, a relative, helped him get a place at Oxford, and continued through life to support him.Hoole took holy orders around 1632, and through the influence of Sanderson was appointed master of Rotherham free school. He became rector of Great Ponton, Lincolnshire in 1642, at the outbreak of the First English Civil War but was sequestrated from the living by Parliament.Moving to London, Hoole made a reputation as a teacher. He taught at private schools, in a house near Maidenhead Court in Aldersgate Street, and in Tokenhouse Gardens in Lothbury.After the Restoration, Sanderson became bishop of Lincoln, made Hoole his chaplain, and looked to give him preferment. On 10 December 1660 he became rector of Stock, Essex, and held the position until his death there on 7 March 1667. He was buried in the chancel of his parish church.

Views on pedagogy
For the upper school forms Hoole recommended a rhetoric text, derived from the Rhetorica of Audomarus Talaeus in the edition by Charles Butler. It was the Rhetorices Elementa (1648) of William Dugard. He advocated the traditional approach of having pupils converse in Latin, but it was dying out by the end of his career. Alongside Latin poetry, he introduced pupils to contemporary poetry in English: George Herbert, Francis Quarles, and Ovid in the translation of George Sandys.
