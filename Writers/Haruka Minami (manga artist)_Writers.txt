Haruka Minami (みなみ 遥, Minami Haruka) is a female Japanese yaoi manga artist born in the Fukushima Prefecture.  She is known for the young appearance of her bishounen character designs and for her "extreme" sex scenes.  Her debut work was "Strawberry Children". Haruka Minami is also known by her debut name Kazuka Minami (南 かずか Minami Kazuka) and she is the author of many erotic yaoi manga, including My Paranoid Next Door Neighbor and Flowered Virgin Soil. As of lately, she seems to prefer writing under Haruka Minami over Kazuka Minami. She is a notable seller of doujinshi at Comiket under the names "MECCA" and "Panis AngeLics", which comes from a misspelling of panis angelicus. Minami also provides illustrations for BL novels.She was to be a guest at Yaoi-Con 2009, but had to pull out due to ill health.
