She denounced Muammar Gaddafi's state visit to France in 2008 due to the track record of his human rights abuse.In November 2008, Yade was rumoured to be Nicolas Sarkozy's favorite choice for replacing Jean-Pierre Jouyet as Secretary of State for European Affairs, and was also privately asked to lead one of the UMP lists for the 2009 European Parliament elections. However, on 7 December, she declined to run for a seat in the European Parliament and declared herself "more interested in national mandate".

We'll see if the left will have the courage to give voice to the people."
