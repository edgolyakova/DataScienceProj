Mariam Mikhaïl Faransis is a Syrian scholar, author and writer, born in Yabroud in 1950. r.b.c. Biography Professor of Stylistics, at the rank of Professor, at the Lebanese University, Department of French Language (1993-2017), member of the International Stylistic Association (AIS), writer and author of several research studies in the field of supraphrastic linguistics of the text. Her researches, written at the same time in French and Arabic, focuses on the construction of the text and on the delimitation of its macro-components. They fundamentally result from a reorganization of two plans of enunciation of Émile Benveniste according to three plans of reference (specific deictic, specific non-deictic, generic adeictic), effectively arranged in double distinction, and the articulation of these plans on the communicative actantial composition of the text. These are supraphrastic linguistic elements of the first importance not only in the characterization of the compositional form of the text, of its configuration, of its arrangement, but also, contrary to what is generally admitted, in the establishment of such and such a fact. meaning and style; what the author has never ceased to emphasize both in her research and during her long career as a professor of stylistics. Along the way, the author finds himself laying the foundations for a supraphrastic linguistics of the text, something well formulated and synthesized in a final work, which will soon be published under the title of Supraphrastic elements for the construction of the text.
