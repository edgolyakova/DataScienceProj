Leonard Huxley (11 December 1860 – 2 May 1933) was an English schoolteacher, writer and editor.

Biography
Family
Huxley's father was the zoologist Thomas Henry Huxley, commonly referred to as 'Darwin's bulldog'. He was educated at University College School, London, the University of St Andrews, and Balliol College, Oxford. He first married Julia Arnold who founded a school. She was the daughter of the academic Tom Arnold. She was a sister of the novelist Mrs Humphry Ward, niece of the poet Matthew Arnold, and granddaughter of Thomas Arnold, the headmaster of Rugby School (immortalised as a character in Tom Brown's Schooldays).
Their four children included the biologist Julian Huxley (1887–1975) and the writer Aldous Huxley (1894–1963). Their middle son, Noel Trevenen (born in 1889), committed suicide in 1914. Their daughter, Margaret Arnold Huxley, was born in 1899. Julia Arnold died of cancer in 1908. 
After the death of his first wife, Leonard married Rosalind Bruce, and had two further sons. The elder of these was David Bruce Huxley (1915–1992), whose daughter Angela married George Pember Darwin, son of the physicist Charles Galton Darwin. The younger was the 1963 Nobel Prize-winning physiologist Andrew Huxley (1917–2012).
