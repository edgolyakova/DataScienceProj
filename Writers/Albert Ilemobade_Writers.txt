Abduction and death

The plot to murder him was hatched on 21 June, by these housekeepers following a failed attempt by Ita, his driver to sell his Toyota SUV car.
On 29 June 2015, his decomposed body was found in his residence at Ijapo estate in Akure, following a reminiscent of the smell of his body decomposition.In an interview with Thisday, Bamitale claimed that Ilemobade was lured out of his house by Daniel, his gate-keeper under the pretense of electric spark within the house and the University Don was strangled to death in front of the gate where he lost the battle to the culprits. Bamitale further stressed that they went back into the house to loot the Professor's mobile phones, iPad, laptop, N7,000 and his Toyota SUV car. The culprits, Bamitale and Ita left for Ogun State that night but was arrested by officers of the Federal Road Safety Corps for driving with invalid vehicle documents but were later released after they paid for the release of the vehicle.
