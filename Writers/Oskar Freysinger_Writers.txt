So that Marxist chienlit has its political counterweight On 3 September 2011 Freysinger gave a speech decrying multiculturalism and Muslim immigration, calling it an attempted conquest, with the statement: "If we lose this battle, there will be no second chance, for Islam does not give back what it has conquered. So I summon all the humanists of this continent not to keep their heads in the sand and to resist the Islamic dogma’s drive to conquest. Let us stand together and uncompromisingly insist upon the primacy of our civil law over any religious dogma. Let us find our way back to our precious intellectual heritage. Islam is only as strong as we are weak." This speech, a film of which is available on YouTube, quickly made him an international celebrity.Freysinger played a crucial role in the 2009 Swiss minaret referendum to ban minarets, and he participated in the 2010 counter-jihad conference in Paris.
