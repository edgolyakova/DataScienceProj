A hospital in Fez was named after him. He was sent by the Moroccan Sultan Mulay Zaidan as an envoy to the Low Countries. He was followed in this role by Al-Hajari, and later Yusuf Biscaino.Muhammad Alguazir was also the author of an anti-Christian polemical work, Apología contra los artículos de la ley Cristiana, written at the order of Mulay Zaidan. == Notes ==
