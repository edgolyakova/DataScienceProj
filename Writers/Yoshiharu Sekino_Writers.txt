Great Journey
Sekino has worked as a surgeon in hospitals in western suburban Tokyo. 
He is better known for his travels in Peru and elsewhere in South America as well as in Africa, where his explorations into the origins of mankind were made into a television series, Gurēto jānī (グレートジャーニー, i.e., "Great Journey"), broadcast on Fuji Television and later available on DVDs.
Starting in 1974, Sekino has published a stream of books about South America, anthropology, exploration, prehistoric demography, and more — some of which are primarily photographic.
