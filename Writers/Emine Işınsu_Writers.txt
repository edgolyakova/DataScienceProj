She grew up in an environment where her mother was constantly talking about literature and poetry was read, and because of her father's duties, she lived for a few years in various parts of the country such as Sarıkamış, Urfa, and Karaman. The schools she grew up in reflect these frequent relocations. She attended primary school in Urfa, Sarıkamış and Ankara. The school from which she graduated from high school is TED Ankara College.

Her body was buried in Ankara Gölbaşı Cemetery after the funeral ceremony held at the Hacı Bayram Mosque the next day. Literary Identity In Işınsu's novels, human psychology comes to the fore more than place descriptions. In her first novel, Küçük Dünya, which was written in the first person singular narration, everything is conveyed by filtering the mood of the protagonist. Although the first person singular is abandoned in her other novels, we still see the events and places after passing through the emotional filter of the heroes and with their perceptions. This psychological weight sometimes resembles a stream of consciousness. Among the novel subjects, the captivity of women, the captivity of the Turks (Bulgaria, Kirkuk, Western Thrace), Turkey's pains come to the fore. In her recent works, the lives of Yunus Emre, Niyazi Mısri, Hacı Bayram Veli and Hacı Bektaş Veli, the peaks of Turkish mysticism, are discussed. Awards "Small World" and T. C.
