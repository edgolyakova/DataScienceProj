He moved to Basra where he graduated with degrees in Arabic and Islamic Studies and then economics from the University of Basra. He was conscripted into the Iraqi army during the Iraq-Iran war and the first Gulf War but faced persecution due his pacifist beliefs and was granted asylum in Spain in 1992 before becoming a Spanish citizen in 1999.In 2011, Naaman became a professor at the Biblical and Oriental Institute in León and taught ecumenical studies of the Pontifical University of Salamanca.Naaman has also authored several books including In the name of God of the three monotheistic religions: Judaism, Christianity and Islam (2012) and All about Islam (2013). Naaman joined the Vox political party in 2016 and announced his intention to stand as a candidate on the municipal list in León, arguing that Spain should defend its Christian culture, oppose the Islamization of Europe and claimed the political left were facilitating Islamism. In 2018, during a public debate in Melilla, Naaman argued that  20% of the world's Muslim population "are radical and fanatical" and "believe in jihad." In response, Podemos accused Naaman of inciting religious and racial hatred. Namaas responded by stating that his argument had not been directed at the entire Muslim community.
