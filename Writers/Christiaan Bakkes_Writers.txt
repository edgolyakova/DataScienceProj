He is married to Marcia Ann Fargnoli, an environmental lawyer. He received a National Diploma in Nature Conservation and led an anti-poaching unit as part of his military service. For a time he worked as a game ranger in the Kruger National Park, where during the early 1990s he was required to be involved in elephant culling, a practice to which he developed ethical objections. In 1994 he suffered serious injury inside the park in a crocodile attack. Hereafter he commenced a new career in the Damaraland desert, where he acted as guide and conservation official for Wilderness Safaris. In 2014, he was nominated as number 7 of the top twenty safari guides in Africa by Conde Nast Traveller.
