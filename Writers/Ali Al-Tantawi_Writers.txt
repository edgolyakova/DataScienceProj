Biography
He was born in Damascus in 1909, into a family of religious scholars: his paternal grandfather, who moved from Egypt, was a graduate of Al-Azhar who specialized in astronomy, his father was an Islamic scholar as well and so was his maternal uncle, Sheikh Muhibb-ud-Deen Al-Khatib. 
Educated at the prestigious Maktab Anbar, he’d then study Islamic law at the University of Damascus, and would militate against the French occupation of Syria, because of which he’ll resume his activities as teacher in Iraq, and later the Zionist project in Palestine, one of the first Islamic scholars putting his attention to this issue. 
Being unable to resume his Islamic activism as he wished, he moved to Saudi Arabia in the late 1960s where he spent the last decades of his life. He died in 1999 and was buried in Jeddah.
