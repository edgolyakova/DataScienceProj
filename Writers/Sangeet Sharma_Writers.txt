Reception
In January 2020, reviewing his book for the Construction Week, Dr. SS Bhatti, former principal of the Chandigarh College of Architecture, said, "Sangeet Sharma's Corb’s Capitol is an important milestone in architectural writing as a narration which says something serious, without being stodgy."Reviewing Sharma's book, Castles in the Air, Soumyabrata Gupta of The Asian Age writes, "Written in a comical manner, Sangeet Sharma delves into the lives of architects as they, often unwittingly, or with oblique aspirations pursue a career to realize others’ dreams. The book, in a humorous manner deals with everything from trying to pursue a degree in architecture to the frustration of dealing with clients and their general distrust with architects."
