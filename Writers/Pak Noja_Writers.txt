Biography Pak was born as Vladimir Tikhonov to a Jewish family in Leningrad, Soviet Union. His Russian name is Vladimir Tikhonov (Russian: Владимир Тихонов), but after immigrating to South Korea in 1997, he changed his name into a Korean name, Pak Noja and became naturalized as a South Korean citizen in 2001.Fascinated by Korean movies and classical literature during his high school days, he decided to study Korean history. In his 16th year, he entered the department of Korean studies at St. Petersburg National University of Russia, and he made his first visit to Korea as an exchange student in 1991 and stayed in Seoul for about 3 months.After his bachelor's degree, Pak kept studying Korean history and was granted a doctorate from Moscow State University with his thesis about Gaya, a combination of city states which lasted until the 6th century in southern part of Korea. While working on his degree, in 1992, Pak met a Korean violinist, Paik Myong-jong (백명정, 1971- ) who was at that time studying at the Leningrad University of Russia; they married in 1995. Pak worked on translating Korean literature into Russian and wrote several liberal arts and sociology books about Korean culture and politics, including his best-selling book, ‘your Korea (당신들의 대한민국)’. His writings made him known as one of Korea’s influential progressive intellectuals, and brought on many controversial issues within Korea by sharp criticism.Pak has taught Russian at Kyunghee University of Korea, and is currently teaching Korean studies as a professor at the Department of Culture Studies and Oriental Languages, University of Oslo in Norway. Statements on China In 2009, he made the remark that the "Korean economy will be annexed by the Chinese economic zone within 5–10 years". The Korean left responded critically to this claim, but Pak went on to clarify his thesis. According to his column, "it is not proper, I just said inescapable".Moreover, he supported the Chinese government with respect to Liu Xiaobo's Nobel Peace Prize. Pak criticized Liu Xiaobo as a "follower of Western countries" and "a supporter of colonialism in China". According to Pak, "the process of democratization in China is not only elite, but also working-class". Pak suggests that Liu's support in his Charter 08 of 'legislative democracy' and the 'protection of private property' raises doubts on whether "Liu Xiaobo wants a 'non-communist, dictatorial China' or a 'worker-friendly China'". Pak claims that "true reform must be undertaken by the working class".
