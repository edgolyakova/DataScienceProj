Edith Catherine MacNeal (née Gould, formerly Wainwright) (August 3, 1901 – September 10, 1937) was an American heiress and writer. Early life Edith was born aboard her father's yacht, Sybarite, on August 3, 1901, while it was anchored off Cold Spring Harbor and was flying the British flag. She was one of seven children born to millionaire George Jay Gould I (1864–1923) and actress Edith Kingdon Gould (1864–1921). Among her siblings were Kingdon Gould Sr., Jay Gould II, Marjorie Gwynne Gould (wife of Anthony Joseph Drexel III), Helen Vivien Gould (wife of John Beresford, 5th Baron Decies), George Jay Gould II, and Gloria Gould (wife of Henry A. Bishop II and Wallace McFarlane Barker).Her father was the eldest son of the former Helen Day Miller and Jay Gould, a leading American railroad developer and speculator who has been referred to as one of the ruthless robber barons of the Gilded Age, whose success at business made him one of the richest men of his era. Her aunt, Anna Gould, was married to two European aristocrats, Boni de Castellane (the elder son and heir apparent of the Marquis of Castellane) and Hélie de Talleyrand-Périgord, Duke of Sagan (Boni's cousin). She attended Miss Spence's School in Manhattan. Career In 1925, Edith wrote her autobiography, "in which she told at length how it felt to be the granddaughter of a millionaire. She told the 'inner secrets' of the Gould family as she new them when a child." Personal life On May 27, 1920, 18 year-old Gould obtained a marriage license a few hours after graduating from Miss Spence's and married artist Carroll Livingston Wainwright, a son of Stuyvesant Wainwright and Caroline Smith (née Snowden) Wainwright. He was a nephew of four star General Jonathan Mayhew Wainwright, who was the hero of Bataan and commander of the U.S. forces in the Philippines during World War II. Through his brother, Loudon, he was the uncle of Loudon Wainwright Jr., and the grand-uncle of Loudon Wainwright III, the singer and songwriter, himself the father of Rufus Wainwright, Martha Wainwright, and Lucy Wainwright Roche.
