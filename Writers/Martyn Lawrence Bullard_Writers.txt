Early life
Born in Lewisham, London, Bullard began his career in design while in his teens.  His father, an actor turned businessman, would accompany his son to the Greenwich Antiques Market in South London, where he rented a stall.  At 13, Bullard began to buy and sell what he called "oddments,"  and learned to identify decorator items that were valuable or well-designed. By the time he was 16, he had developed a clientele of prominent dealers and collecters, including the head buyer for Ralph Lauren Antiques, who shipped Bullard's pieces to the United States to dress the windows of Lauren's Madison Avenue and Rodeo Drive boutiques.At 17, Bullard decided to pursue a career as an actor, and used his earnings to attend the Lee Strasberg Actors Studio in London's Covent Garden.  While in school, Bullard continued to buy and sell antiques and raised enough money to move to Los Angeles in 1994.

Career
Interior design
After moving to Los Angeles, Bullard was cast in several roles, including a part as Eartha Kitt's boy toy in Ed Wood's final film,  I Woke Up Early The Day I Died.   One of the film's producers visited Bullard's home, and, impressed by its decor, invited Bullard to decorate his office.  From there, Bullard was hired to decorate the office and home of Liz Heller, a Capitol Records executive, and was eventually asked to help create Heller's wedding to producer John Bard Manulis. As a guest at the event, he was seated next to Cheryl Tiegs, who became his first celebrity client. Together, Tiegs and Bullard transformed Tiegs' Bel Air home into a "Balinese-inspired pavilion," which was featured in publications worldwide, and appeared on the cover of more than a dozen magazines.
After his success with Cheryl Tiegs' house, Bullard began to build a celebrity clientele. His early clients included Rebecca Romijn and John Stamos, Christina Aguilera, William H. Macy and Felicity Huffman, Eva Mendes, Patti LaBelle, and Edward Norton. In more recent years, Bullard has gone on to decorate homes for Kylie Jenner, Khloe Kardashian, Kourtney Kardashian, Cher, Ellen Pompeo, Sharon and Ozzy Osbourne, Kid Rock, and Tommy Hilfiger, among many others.

Bullard also has two books published by Rizzoli, Live, Love & Decorate, reached its third reprint in its first 16 weeks of release, and topped the best-seller list in the interior design genre.

Style
Bullard's style has been described as "Hollywood glamour meets ethnic exotica," and "eclectic, luxurious, sophisticated, comfortable and fearless." He has been noted for his "adventurous use of texture, colour and extreme attention to detail," and his "strong command of proportion and scale, a deft hand with color and pattern, and an exuberantly global sensibility."

Television
From 2011 to 2013, Bullard starred in the hit Bravo series Million Dollar Decorators, examining the world of high-end interior designers. In a 2012 interview, Bullard, whose appearances on the show frequently feature his celebrity clients, said "Celebrities live their lives in the spotlight. As such, it's vital for their homes to be sanctuaries – places for complete relaxation and privacy. My one great joy with my celebrity clients over the years has been their passion to live out their fantasies, be it an Indian palace in Hollywood, a Tuscan villa in Malibu or an English country cottage in New York City. I'm here to be their enabler and make these fantasies into decorative reality."Bullard also starred in Hollywood Me, a series which brought unsuspecting Brits to Los Angeles for personal makeovers while Bullard redecorated their homes.  Hollywood Me, which won a National Reality Television Award in its inaugural season, launched in the UK in 2012 and aired in South Africa and Australia in 2013.
