Work
Škerbec founded the Tržič Parish Bulletin (Slovene: Cerkveni glasnik za tržiško župnijo) in 1924 and edited it until 1928. In 1925 he founded the Runa Leatherworkers' Association in Tržič. From 1929 to 1941 he edited the Kranj Bell (Slovene: Kranjski zvon), the parish bulletin for Kranj.He was a member of the Slovene People's Party, in which he was engaged with labor and social issues, closely associating with Marko Natlačen and Anton Korošec. In 1932 he was arrested and then imprisoned in 1933 for a year for participating in the anti-regime incident known as the Šenčur Events (Slovene: Šenčurski dogodki) on May 22, 1932.He started working for the Caritas charity in Ljubljana in 1942, which not only aided refugees, but also helped finance the anti-communist MVAC. In 1943 he participated in the Anticommunist Committee (Slovene: Protikomunistični odbor) and helped organized the Home Guard in Upper Carniola. In May 1945 he emigrated first to Austrian Carinthia, where he participated in establishing the Social Committee for the Assistance of Slovenian Refugees, and then to the United States.After the war, Škerbec lived in Cleveland, Ohio, where his writings focused on wartime and postwar atrocities. These publications detailed not only large-scale events, such as the Kucja Valley massacre, Kočevski Rog massacre, and Bleiburg death marches, but also more local events such as the extrajudicial killings at Babna Gora, Brezje pri Dobrovi, and Žažar.Following the death of exiled Bishop Gregorij Rožman in 1959, Škerbec was a central figure in Slovenian emigration, in both religious and secular matters. Škerbec died on October 17, 1963 at St. Vincent Charity Hospital in Cleveland.
