Lt. Colonel Arthur Owen Vaughan,  (6 September 1863 – 15 October 1919), also known by his bardic name Owen Rhoscomyl, was an English-born writer, soldier and Welsh nationalist. Born as Robert Scowfield Mills in England, Owen Rhoscomyl was influenced by his Welsh grandmother and became a notable patriot to Wales and its history. Early life Vaughan was born in Southport, but moved to Droylsden, Lancashire where he was raised. As a child, Vaughan was highly influenced by his maternal grandmother, who was born in Tremeirchion in North Wales. At the age of 15 he ran away from home and went to sea, travelling to America. There he became a cowboy and found work in mining camps before returning to Britain. Military career In 1887 he joined the 1st (Royal) Dragoons.

While in this unit, Sergeant Vaughan was mentioned for bravery under fire and awarded the DCM. In October 1901 he joined Ross's Canadian Scouts, an anti-commando outfit previously led by Arthur L. Howard, in which Vaughan reached the rank of captain.When the First World War broke out in August 1914, Vaughan was prominent in recruiting a new regiment in South Wales, the Welsh Horse Yeomanry, hoping - in vain, as it turned out - to be given command.

In 1906 he wrote the novel Old Fireproof, followed by Vronina (1906) and Lone Tree Lode (1913). He was a member of Legion of Frontiersmen. In 1909 Vaughan scripted the National Pageant of Wales, held at Cardiff Castle. In 1911 he scripted the National Pageant at the Investiture of the Prince of Wales in Carnarvon Castle.He and Katherine had four children. Katherine died in 1927, while Vaughan died in 1919.

Vaughan, with the badge of the King's Own Yorkshire Light Infantry and a Celtic cross honouring his achievements for the Welsh under his bardic name Owen Roscomyl.
