He was a contributor and sub-editor of the Dublin Review from 1863 to early 1865, but he and Henry James Coleridge left when editor William George Ward refused to publish a major article on the reviews of John Henry Newman's Apologia Pro Vita Sua. Ward was inclined to give the book as little publicity as possible.In the mid-1880s, he lived on Hinde Street, Manchester Square. He was a contributor to Wilfrid Meynell's Merrie England magazine. The latter years of his life, which were spent at Cheltenham, he devoted to religious literature.

Most of this work consisted in the adaptations of foreign books which he thought were of value to English-speaking Catholics. Family On 30 July 1844 at Marylebone, he married Harriet Diana Calvert, daughter of Nicholson Calvert of Hunsdon and Frances Pery, daughter and co-heir of the Viscount Pery. Born at Hunsdon, Hertfordshire, 1811; Harriet died at Cheltenham, Gloucestershire, 21 Aug., 1896.
