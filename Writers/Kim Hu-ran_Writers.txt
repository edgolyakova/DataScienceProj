Work
In her poetry, Kim Hu-ran attempts to create a world of perfect equilibrium and absolute beauty through the practice of self-discipline and control. This great artistic endeavor coincides with the poet's approach towards life seen in "On The Tree" (Namueseo), in which the poet cultivates mind and soul in order to attain wisdom and maturity. Her poems analyze the conflicts and contradictions of life with a modernist sensibility and capture the beauty and complexities of nature. Her early poems "Trees on the Riverside" (Ganggae seon namu), "Echoing in the Sea" (Badae mearijineun) and " In Front of the Pagoda" (Dabotab apeseo) aptly portray the many trials and tribulations inherent in life.Kim was also known as a lyrical (as opposed to 'ontological') poet, aligned with others including Heu Young-ja, Chung Jin-kyu, Lee Keun-bae, Oh Tak-bon, Yoo An-jin, Park E-dou, Ra Tae-joo, Lee Soo-ik, Song Soo-Kwon, Oh Sae-young, Lee Geon-cheong, Kim Jong-hae, Shin Dalja, Lim Young-jo, Lee Sung-sun, Moon Chung-hee, Kim Hyeong-young, Cho Jeong-kwon, Hong Shin-seon, Sin Dae-chul, Kim Jong-hae, Kim Jong-chul, Lee Garim, Kim Seung-hee, Lee Jun-gwan, Lee kee-chul, Cho Chang-whan, and Yoon Suk-san
