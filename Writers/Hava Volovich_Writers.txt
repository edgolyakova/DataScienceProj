Hava Vladimirovna Volovich (ru:Волович, Хава Владимировна;1916–2000), was a Ukrainian writer, actress, puppet theater director and Gulag survivor. In literary value and historical witness, her notes from the Soviet forced labour camps have been compared with Shalamov's stories and Anne Frank's Diary. Anne Applebaum wrote that Volovich stands out in the anthology "Gulag Voices", as she, like Elena Glinka, was not afraid to touch upon taboo subjects Volovich's story about her own child in the camp contrasts to some stereotypes about the selfishness and venality of gulag prisoners who bore children there.
