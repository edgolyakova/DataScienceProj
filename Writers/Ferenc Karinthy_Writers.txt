Napló (Journal), the diary Karinthy kept between 1969 and 1991, was published posthumously in 1994.

Epepe (Metropole)
Epepe, written in 1970, is the most well-known of Karinthy's novels to be translated into English, appearing as Metropole in 2008.This essentially Kafkaesque tale follows the travails of Budai, a linguist who steps off a plane expecting to be in Helsinki but finds himself in a sprawling and densely populated metropolis whose residents speak an unknown and unintelligible language. Budai is swept along with the crowd to a hotel, where he tries in vain to explain his predicament.
With no route home apparent, Budai spends his days trying to learn what he can about the city and the language but is frustrated at every turn. The only person with whom he has any kind of relationship is Epepe, who operates the lift in his hotel. But even she can't help when Budai's money runs out and his situation becomes ever more desperate.
