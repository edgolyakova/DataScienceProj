The Town Board, Borough Court, and Board of Guardians all adjourned, as a mark of respect to his memory, while the Vicar-General of the diocese wrote a most sympathetic letter to his father. In fact he had fled to London, after which he became a member of the Church of Ireland.He edited a paper called The Catholic, which had a considerable circulation, and wrote Hear the Other Side and a number of other books and pamphlets, which had a wide circulation. He set up a mission at 5IB Dawson Street, Dublin. With the assistance of his brother, Mr Joseph Connellan, he embarked upon the evangelisation of Ireland. References External links Roscommon History
