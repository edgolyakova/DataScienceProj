Daniel Huws (born 1932) is the world's leading authority of the last hundred years on Welsh manuscripts, with contributions that are held to represent a significant advance on those of John Gwenogvryn Evans.He is noted in particular for his studies of individual manuscripts, and these, alongside portraits of significant Renaissance collectors, made up his work Medieval Welsh Manuscripts, now recognised as the key academic text of this dimension of Wales' written history and culture. As of 2015, his work focuses on the history of Welsh manuscripts continuing up to 1800. His work has also included other projects on Wales, including The Poets of the Princes, The Poets of the Gentry, Prose Texts from Manuscripts, and The Poems of Dafydd ap Gwilym. He has written on Welsh music, as well as publishing three volumes of poetry with Secker and Warburg and Faber and Faber. A university friend and associate of Ted Hughes, he has written a memoir of the poet. He was awarded the Derek Allen Prize by the British Academy in 2006. Life Huws was raised in London and Anglesey, and attended a school in Llangefni before studying Archaeology and Anthropology at Peterhouse, Cambridge. He worked at the National Library of Wales between 1961 and 1992, and is also a member of the Welsh Academy. As a student, Huws became a close friend of Ted Hughes, and his 2010 Memories of Ted Hughes 1952–1963 chronicles his experiences of the poet at an early age, his circle at Cambridge, the development of his relationship with Sylvia Plath, and their later life in London. Huws and his wife unsuccessfully campaigned to prevent the closure of the Catholic church in the centre of Aberystwyth. His sister worked as an artist in Paris. Academic works Huws, Daniel (1986).
