Clack is a supporter of Welsh independence and attended a pro-independence rally in Merthyr Tydfil in September 2019, organised by AUOB Cymru. "I have always favoured Welsh Independence because every country should be independent," he said. "The opposite of independent after all is dependent and to be dependent on anyone or an organisation where that dependence isnâ€™t based on love, kindness and genuine care is demeaning." At the 2019 general election, Clack stood as Plaid Cymru's candidate for the Cardiff West constituency.
