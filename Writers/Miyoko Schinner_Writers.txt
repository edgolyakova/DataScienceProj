Miyoko Schinner (née Nishimoto) is an American vegan activist, entrepreneur, chef, cookbook author, and founder of the dairy-free goods company, Miyoko's Creamery. She is considered a pioneer in the production of vegan cheese. Early life and education Schinner was born in a town outside of Tokyo, Japan as Miyoko Nishimoto. She came to the United States when she was seven, grew up in Mill Valley, California, and at age 12 decided to become a vegetarian (which led her to cooking her own meals). She began college at the Pratt Institute in order to study graphic design, but dropped out after a year. She eventually transferred to St. John's College in Annapolis, and graduated with a B.A. in Philosophy in 1979. Early career After moving to Japan, Schinner transitioned to eating vegan in the mid-1980s. In 1994, she opened the vegan restaurant Now and Zen in San Francisco. It eventually expanded into a natural food company of the same name, and was sold in 2003.Schinner also launched the UnTurkey brand, which she exhibited at the 1995 Natural Products Expo alongside competitor Tofurky. Miyoko's Creamery In 2014, Schinner launched vegan cheese company Miyoko's Kitchen, later renaming it Miyoko's Creamery. Tofurky founder Seth Tibbott was the company's first investor. In 2016, the Specialty Food Association reported the company had "grown 300% year over year," and "they recently signed on to a new 28,000 square-foot headquarters in Petaluma." Legal Schinner is a leading advocate for the right of vegan food products to use traditional meat and dairy terms on their labels. In particular, she has been involved in legal challenges over product laws that regulate vegan food labeling, with Schinner arguing the laws violate free speech.In August of 2021, Miyoko's Creamery prevailed in their lawsuit against the California Department of Food and Agriculture's attempts to force the company to cease using the words "Cheese" and "Butter" among others in the marketing of their products.In February 2023, Miyoko's Creamery announced that it and Schinner had parted ways. In addition, on February 16, Miyoko's Creamery also filed a law suit against her, alleging that she misappropriated confidential information and copied the data to her personal cloud after the board of directors voted to terminate her as CEO. The case was filed in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California, Case 3:23-cv-00711.On March 3, 2023, Schinner’s attorney Lisa Bloom announced that Schinner would be filing a wrongful termination counter lawsuit. Bloom stated: “The company's behavior in forcing her out of the company she created and built, then trashing her via an outrageously malicious and misleading lawsuit will be met with facts and witnesses showing that Miyoko's own complaints of toxic and sexist behavior by certain male executives were swept under the rug, and then she was demoted and fired.” Rancho Compasión In 2015, Schinner founded the nonprofit Rancho Compasión farmed animal sanctuary in Nicasio, California.
