The show, including 13 Caribbean artists, was first exhibited at the National Library in Port of Spain, Trinidad, and then in October 2006 at the Museum of Modern Art in Santo Domingo, Dominican Republic.With Dixon, she co-authored the book Travels with a Husband, launched in November 2016, in conjunction with an exhibition of Dixon's artwork.
