His engagement with Buryat cultural, educational, social and political events began in his teens. In the spring of 1934, he became a member of the newly created Union of Writers of Buryatia. He was a journalist at the newspaper Buriaad-Mongoloy Onen. The poem "Airplane", written by him at the age of 19, became an event in the literary life of Buryatia.
