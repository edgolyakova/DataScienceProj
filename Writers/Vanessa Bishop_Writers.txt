Following this, Virgin Publishing published two of her stories in volumes of their Doctor Who short story anthologies, Decalog. She has also had a short story published in one of Big Finish Productions' Short Trips collections.
Bishop is also rumoured to have written a regular column for Doctor Who Magazine in the late 1990s, as the fictional female fan "Jackie Jenkins".Vanessa Bishop took over the reviewing section of Doctor Who Magazine following the previous incumbent Dave Owen's departure, although Owen later returned to the column to review some items Bishop did not have time to cover, due to the extensive expansion in the amount of spin-off merchandise being produced.
