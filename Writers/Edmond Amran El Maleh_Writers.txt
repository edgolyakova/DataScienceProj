Edmond Amran El Maleh (Arabic: إدمون عمران المالح) (30 March 1917 – 15 November 2010) was a Moroccan Jewish writer of Berber extraction.

Biography
El Maleh was born in Safi, Morocco to a Jewish Berber family. He moved to Paris in 1965, working there as a journalist and a teacher of philosophy.
He only began writing in 1980, at the age of 63, traveling back and forth between France and Morocco. He stated that, in spite of his long stay in France, he had devoted his entire literary life to Morocco. From 1999 until his death he lived in Rabat.El Maleh was an anti-Zionist and declared that his father had taught him that Zionism had nothing to do with Judaism, and that what Jews were doing to Palestinians was against the principles of the Jewish faith. He remained as a result isolated and ignored by most of the Moroccan Jewish community.
He was buried, according to his wishes, in the Jewish cemetery in Essaouira. He wrote in French.

Works
Parcours immobile (Maspero, 1983)
In the words of El Maleh: "Ce livre reflète un désir de plus en plus affirmé d'approfondir mon enracinement dans la culture marocaine, où j'ai tenté non pas de transcrire mais de faire revivre mon expérience de jeune juif marocain ayant lutté contre le colonialisme et ensuite militant au sein du mouvement communiste." (This book reflects a desire to deepen more and more the sense that I'm rooted in the Moroccan culture, where I've tried not to copy but to relive my experience of a young Moroccan Jew who fought against colonialism and as a militant within the communist movement)
