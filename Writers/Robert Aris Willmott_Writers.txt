His father went to London, and had money troubles. In October 1819 he was admitted at Merchant Taylors' school. He entered Harrow School in January or February 1825. There in March 1828 he brought out the first number of the Harrovian, which ran to six numbers.At the close of 1828 Willmott became tutor to Thomas Green, and remained so for about two years. He entered Trinity College, Cambridge, in 1832, but his matriculation was deferred until 17 February 1834. While at Cambridge he earned his living by his pen. He graduated B.A. on 26 May 1841.Willmott in 1842 was ordained deacon by Charles James Blomfield, Bishop of London, to the curacy of St. James, Ratcliff; and he was ordained priest on 11 June 1843.

Thomas William Allies at Launton, Oxfordshire. The church of St. Catherine, Bearwood, which had been erected with the support of John Walter, was consecrated on 23 April 1846, and Willmott was appointed by him as its first incumbent. Initially he was on good terms with the patron, but about 1861 differences arose with the patron, and Willmott resigned the benefice in May 1862 on a pension.Willmott moved to Nettlebed in Oxfordshire, and began writing for the Churchman's Family Magazine.’ He was engaged in the preparation of three new books when he was incapacitated by an attack of paralysis.
