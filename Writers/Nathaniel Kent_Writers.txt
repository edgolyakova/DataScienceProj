The acquaintance of Benjamin Stillingfleet, the naturalist, was valuable to him.Kent's published writings brought him employment on a large scale as an estate agent and land valuer, and he worked to improve English methods of land management. His subsequent work in agriculture was mainly in Norfolk, but he also suggested extensive embankments in Lincolnshire, which were successfully carried out. He was for a short time bailiff of George III's farm in the Windsor Great Park.On 25 Nov 1766, at St. James, Piccadilly, Kent married Miss Ann Powell.

Returning to England in 1766, he drew up an account of Flemish husbandry at the request of Sir John Cust, the Speaker of the House of Commons, who persuaded Kent to devote himself to agriculture.Kent published in 1775 Hints to Gentlemen of Landed Property (3rd edition 1793) with coverage going as far as labourers' cottages.

Details on the king's farm, communicated by him to the Society of Arts in 1798, were subsequently published as a pamphlet.
