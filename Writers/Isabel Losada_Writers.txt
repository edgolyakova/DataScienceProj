Sensation Sensation (Watkins) is Losada's account of a year spent exploring the subject of sex between heterosexual couples, and in particular what makes sex into good sex in long term and loving relationships. The research for the book involved participation in various courses, couple workshops, women-only weekends and attending the first international conference on Orgasmic Meditation. The book, part memoir and part manifesto in the cause for better relationships between men and women, has been praised for its honesty about a subject often shrouded in fear and shame despite the so-called sexual revolution. Russell Brand, who interviewed Losada for an episode of his podcast Under the Skin with Russell Brand, stated that "I have learnt from Isabel that we are not approaching sex in a very conscious and connected way. It's very interesting to read a woman talking plainly and mechanically about sex. I want to learn this stuff."

How to Practice Without Preaching (Watkins) is Losada's collection of stories, reflections and ideas about the steps that an individual can take to help save the environment and the planet.
