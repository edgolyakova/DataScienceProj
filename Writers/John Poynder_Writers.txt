John Poynder (1779–1849) was an English lawyer and theological writer, best known for his Literary Extracts and as a proponent of Christian. missions in India

Life
He was eldest son of a tradesman in the city of London; his mother belonged to the evangelical wing of the Church of England. He attended a school at Newington Butts, kept by Joseph Forsyth. He wanted in early life to undertake a career in the English church, but entered a solicitor's office.
For nearly forty years Poynder was clerk and solicitor to the royal hospitals of Bridewell and Bethlehem, and for three years he was under-sheriff of London and Middlesex.

Activism
The Rev. William Jay was his lifelong friend. Moved by  sermons of Jay and Claudius Buchanan, Poynder set himself to rouse proprietors of East India Company against the Company's religious tolerance. For many years he contended almost singlehanded in the court of proprietors at the East India House, for the prohibition of the custom of sati; the practice was stopped by Lord William Bentinck. Poynder also investigated the profits made by the company from worshippers and pilgrims at the temples of Jagannath, Gya and Allahabad.

Death
Poynder died at Montpelier House, South Lambeth, on 10 March 1849. Poynder's library was sold by Sotheby & Co. on 10 Jan. 1850 and two following days. The collection included the Phænomena et Diosemeia of Aratus Solensis, with autograph and annotations of John Milton.
