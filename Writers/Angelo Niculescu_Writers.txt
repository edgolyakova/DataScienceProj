Angelo Niculescu (1 October 1921 – 20 June 2015) was a Romanian football player and  manager. He is best remembered in Romania for being the national team's coach at the 1970 World Cup and for inventing the "temporizare" ("delaying") tactics in which the team keeps the possession of the ball inside its own half and the players are using many short passes from one side to another of the field in order to disrupt the opponents patience when they go out of their field to make pressing, this is also considered an early form of tiki-taka, with such tactics he managed to qualify Romania to a World Cup after more than 30 years and register a win against Czechoslovakia.

Playing career
Angelo Niculescu was born on 1 October 1921 in Craiova, Romania and he started playing football in 1937 at age 15 in Divizia B at local club Rovine Grivița. In 1939 he moved to play for neighboring team, FC Craiova with whom he won the 1942–43 championship which was not recognized by the Romanian Football Federation because the teams from Transylvania were unable to participate as the territory was annexed to Hungary due to the Second Vienna Award. During World War II his career was interrupted for a while as he was called by the Romanian Army to fight in the Eastern Front. In 1945, Niculescu went to play for Carmen București where he stayed two years, moving afterwards at Ciocanul București who after one year merged with Carmen in order to form Dinamo București where he played in the following two years, ending his career at age 29 in which he earned a total of 93 Divizia A appearances with 3 goals scored.
