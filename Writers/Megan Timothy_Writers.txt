In 1964 Timothy moved to California aged 21. There, she worked as a switchboard operator and a waitress at the Playboy Club. Timothy was fired from Playboy after she reportedly threw water in a patron's face in an effort to extinguish a fire on his beard that she had set while attempting to light his cigarette. After leaving Playboy, Timothy began working as an actor and screenwriter.In the mid 1970s, Timothy purchased a bed and breakfast in North Hollywood, Los Angeles called La Maida House, which she ran until the 1990s. In 1999, and in now in her late 50s, she sold her North Hollywood home, her car and a number of her possessions. This was in preparation to undertake what would be a 12,000-mile solo bicycle journey. Her journey would take her to various places in Western Europe and to parts of Africa. In 2003, she suffered a brain aneurysm and lost her ability to speak. Her book Let Me Die Laughing!: Waking from The Nightmare of a Brain Explosion details her injury and road to recovery.

Stroke
After her mother died, and having lost most of her possessions in a fire, Timothy suffered a stroke in September 2003, at the age of 63. The stroke was caused by arteriovenous malformation. She suffered severe aphasia as a result of the stroke. Being unable to speak and having no family and no funds to look after herself, she became a ward of the state and was housed in a rehabilitation facility for two weeks. According to the September/October edition of Stroke Connection magazine, the rehabilitation facility was actually a mental hospital. She was told by the head nurse there that she would not be able to read and write or speak again. A couple of her friends managed to get her released. Prior to the stroke, Timothy did not have any kind of medical coverage, but was eventually enrolled in a California Medicaid program. A short documentary called Chicken, which was about her stroke and her adventure, was screened at the Fontaine Auditorium of Samuel Merritt University, 400 Hawthorne Avenue, Oakland, on Wednesday, August 4, 2010.
