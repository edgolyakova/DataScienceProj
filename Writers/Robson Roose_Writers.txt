He owed his professional success to his social popularity.Doctor to Lord Randolph Churchill and Jennie Churchill, Roose treated the young Winston Churchill, aged 11, for pneumonia in March 1886. He entered Trinity Hall, Cambridge that year, but did not reside or take a degree. With Thomas Buzzard, he was attending physician to Lord Randolph who was terminally ill in the 1890s.
