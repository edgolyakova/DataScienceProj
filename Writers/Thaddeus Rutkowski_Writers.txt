Critical reception
Kirkus Reviews, reviewing Violent Outbursts, wrote "Insouciant, twee, and aphoristic, Rutkowskiâ€™s voice handily skewers stupidity".In writing on Rutkowski's third novel Haywire, Publishers Weekly wrote that "unlike a lot of flash fiction, which tends to be built around a conceit or written toward a punch line, Rutkowski's best moments crackle unimpeded by self-consciousness".Peter Selgin, in writing about Haywire in the American Book Review said "...."[Rutkowski's] works build their effects cumulatively, through an accretion of discreet moments, ... so reading them is like eating a bag of potato chips, with each non-sequitur scene its own salty, satisfying morsel ('Bet you can't eat just one')"...

Awards
In 2012, Rutkowski was awarded a fellowship in fiction from the New York Foundation for the Arts.Also in 2012, his book Haywire was named a finalist for Best Fiction by the Asian American Literary Awards.
