He co-wrote the song "The Saga," which is on side 2 of the second album, "The Libertines."His relationship with Doherty led Roundhill to expose him on the website www.balachadha.com, claiming that fans could get a closer insight into Doherty's life. He recorded videos on a webcam of Doherty playing acoustic guitar, smoking drugs and self-harming. Smart Software Services charged fans a small fee to watch these videos.He appears for 4 seconds in the Babyshambles music video for song "The Blinding,"  also featuring in and co-directing of "Verse of Baudelaire" music promo, written by Robert James Selby, set in London's East End.

Death of Mark Blanco Mark Blanco, a 30-year-old actor, died in 2006 after plunging 11 feet (3.4 m) to his death from a first floor balcony outside Roundhill's flat in east London after being ejected by Roundhill. Blanco, who had been drinking, had allegedly become physically aggressive towards Doherty, a fellow guest. During the altercation before he was ejected, Roundhill took Blanco's hat off and set it alight, allegedly in an attempt to distract him away from the singer. Doherty and Roundhill were interviewed by police, and neither were considered suspects in Blanco's death. More recent findings indicate that Blanco may have been pushed from the balcony, and his family is attempting to get the police to investigate the case again.Singer/songwriter Paul Cunniffe also died in a fall from Roundhill's flat in August 2001. Roundhill claims to have no memory of that incident.

He pleaded guilty to the offence and received a 12-month conditional discharge.Roundhill was living at a Salvation Army homeless centre by Canary Wharf in 2009 but after relapsing several times he was asked to leave by the centre management.
