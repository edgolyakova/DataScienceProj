Education
Her grandfather, an immigrant from Meixian, Guangdong, China, was afraid that his grandchildren would lose their identity as Chinese. Therefore, he encouraged Sidharta to learn Mandarin. Fortunately for Sidharta, there was a female Mandarin teacher staying in her grandparents' house who could teach her.
Sidharta obtained a master's degree in psychology from Rijks Universitet, Leiden, Netherlands.
Sidharta speaks German, Dutch, French, Mandarin, Hokkien, Malay, Indonesian and English.

In Search of My Ancestral Home
In her autobiography, she revealed that in 1872, her grandfather's family was not rich and they had to sell his youngest brother to obtain passage money overseas, and also to leave some money for his mother, who was going to stay behind.
When China became a Communist country, and Indonesia was declared independent, her grandfather's family had to choose between Dutch or Indonesian citizenship.
Sidharta also discussed the many discriminatory rules experienced by ethnic Chinese of Indonesia in the 1950s, which caused many Chinese to decide to leave for China.
Sidharta details her journey to Meixian and how being with her relatives in China brought her happiness.
