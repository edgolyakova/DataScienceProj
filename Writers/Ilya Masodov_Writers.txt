Ilya Masodov (unknown; some sources state 1966) is a modern Russian writer. Biography According to the publisher, Ilya Masodov was born in 1966 in Leningrad. He worked as a school teacher for a while and moved to Germany. There is no trustworthy evidence of the existence of the writer. An agent of the writer, Dmitry Volchek, stated that Masodov is a real person, but Volchek himself is not aware of the fate of the writer after 2003. Debate over the identity of Masodov and the authorship There is a discussion about whether Ilya Masodov is a real writer. According to one theory, Masodov is a pseudonym derived from the names of other Russian writers such as "Ma-" for Mamleev, "-so-" for Sorokin and "-dov" for Radov (or less commonly, for "Dovlatov"). Other people consider the name as an anagram from von Sacher-Masoch and Marquis de Sade. It is also argued that Ilya Masodov is a project of Marusya Klimova or her publisher named Dmitry Volchek.
