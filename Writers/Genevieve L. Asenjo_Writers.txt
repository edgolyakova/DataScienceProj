Reviews/Studies on Genevieve Asenjo's work Water and/or bodies of water is the predominant motif in the poems of Genevieve Asenjo created in the years 1995 to 2005 and was published in her book Pula ang Kulay ng Text Message. The recurrence of water and bodies of water in her works signifies the presence and importance of the said resource to Antique and to the Antique√±os. As a vital part of the community, water also represents artistic expression and human experience which in return reflects West Visayan culture, tradition and identity. - Bea Altar, et al.
