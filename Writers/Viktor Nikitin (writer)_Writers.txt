Viktor Nikolaevich Nikitin (15 November 1960 – 30 September 2020) was a Russian writer, playwright and editor. He was a member of the Union of writers of Russia. Biography Nikitin graduated from the Voronezh Institute of Civil Engineering (road traffic department). He lived in Voronezh and worked in his early years as a prose editor in the magazine Pod"yom; from 2005 to 2015, he was the editor of the prose department of the «Russkiy pereplot» portal. Writing career Nikitin started writing in 1986 (when his first story, Clever, was published in the Voronezh newspaper Molodoy Kommunar). His works were published in the magazines Rise, Moscow, Zvezda, Our Contemporary, October, Siberian Lights, Russian Echo, Gates of Siberia, Don, North, Russian Federation today; and in the newspapers Komsomolskaya Pravda, Literaturnaya Gazeta, Uchitelskaya Gazeta, Rossiyskiy Pisatel, Interpol-Express and others. He wrote stories, essays, and plays, including Open / Closed, 2004; Viva Stalin!, 2006; Drinking with Chekhov, 2006; A horse has hooves, a man has legs, 2007; Death of the Middle Class, 2008; Afternoon Cruel Disappointment, 2009; and the novel Songs of the Working Class, published in 2011.The main theme of his work was the impossibility of the presence of a traditional person in the modern world, with a place for "black humor" and mysticism, irony and sarcasm, satire and grotesque. His 2005 novel Will Disappear Like Birds was a complex, multifaceted work about the life of a "superfluous person" in the Soviet era, and then in democratic market times, saturated with allusions and presenting a phantasmagoric picture of an unstable world. Death Nikitin died from COVID-19 in Voronezh on 30 September 2020, aged 59, during the COVID-19 pandemic in Russia. Selected works Will disappear like birds (novel).
