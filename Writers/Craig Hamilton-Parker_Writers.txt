Craig Hamilton-Parker (born 24 January 1954) is a British self-styled psychic, referred to by the popular press as the "Prophet of Doom", who achieved notoriety for supposedly predicting Brexit and the election of Donald Trump. He is also a prolific author on spiritualist subjects.

Psychic predictions
Hamilton-Parker's predicted two significant events of 2016: the exit of the United Kingdom from the European Union, and the election of Donald Trump as President of the United States. He also predicted that the post-Brexit economy of the United Kingdom would "thrive", with a strong pound and weak euro. Hamilton-Parker's claim to predicting Brexit and Trump has been disputed. During the 2016 Republican primaries, he originally predicted Jeb Bush would win, and his predictions for the actual act of Britain leaving the European Union were several years ahead of schedule.Hamilton-Parker also claims to have predicted the COVID-19 pandemic, claiming in 2017 that a flu pandemic would sweep the world at some future point. In 2019, he predicted that Theresa May would pass a Brexit deal on 29 March and immediately resign to be succeeded by Boris Johnson. Prior to the 2020 United States presidential election, he predicted that Donald Trump would win a second term with "unexpected" states such as Florida and that Joe Biden would drop out of the primaries.Hamilton-Parker has been remarked for frequently making bleak and dystopian predictions. He has been colloquially referred to as the "new Nostradamus".

Mediumship
Hamilton-Parker is also a medium, someone who asserts they can channel and communicate with the deceased. His highest-profile demonstration of mediumship was in 2003, when he purportedly contacted the spirit of Princess Diana on a pay-per-view television program. The program received significant criticism for airing without the consent of her sons, and was only broadcast in the United States due to United Kingdom broadcast laws. A number of sequences were cut due to potentially violating Independent Television Commission guidelines. It was also criticised in America, with one reviewer describing the show as "exploitation at its very worst". The seance was attended by Louise Carr-Reed, Princess Diana's personal assistant at the time of her death.Hamilton-Parker, alongside his wife Jane, starred in the BBC 2 series Mediums: Talking to the Dead in 2004.

Hamilton-Parker has published thirty-one books on New Age topics since 1995.
