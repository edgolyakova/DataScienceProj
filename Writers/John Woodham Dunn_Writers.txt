Lifetime
The Rev. John Woodham Dunn M.A. was born 17 September 1812. He married Sarah Emily Yarker, the daughter of Rev Luke Yarker JP and Mrs Mary Beata Yarker (née South) on 19 September 1845. (Sarah was born in Stanhope, County Durham in 1821 and died on 2 March 1931). They had a son Hugh Percy Dunn, born 24 August 1854 at Warkworth, Northumberland, England and died 2 March 1931.
Dunn gained his BA at Queens' College, Cambridge and was appointed curate of Longhoughton and of Lesbury, and successively vicar of Matterdale and Dalton. In 1853 he became vicar of The  Church of St Lawrence, Warkworth. He was awarded an MA in 1866. He died 18 September 1883.
