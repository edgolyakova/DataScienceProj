Andy Saunders (Andrew Roy Saunders) is an English author and researcher from East Sussex who specializes in military aviation history with particular emphasis on the Battle of Britain and the air war over north-west Europe between 1939 and 1945. He regularly contributes to the world’s aviation press on military history topics and has also written for national newspapers, including “The Mail on Sunday”. He is a former editor of Britain at War magazine, published by Lincolnshire-based Key Publishing. He was also a programme consultant for the Discovery History series “War Digs With Harry Harris” and is currently involved in a number of projected television documentaries for various production companies working as contributor, researcher or consultant. In 2001, he pleaded guilty to offences under the Protection of Military Remains Act after recovering the aircraft of Flying Officer George Edward Kosh, a Hawker Typhoon which crashed in 1944 in East Sussex, without a licence. He was given a one-year conditional discharge after the court heard he had committed a technical offence only which related to going ahead with the excavation of the wreckage a month before he had the appropriate Ministry of Defence licence. In 2005 he was the principal contributor and consultant for the Channel 4 documentary “Who Downed Douglas Bader” (Wildfire TV) and more recently has had input to BBC Timewatch programmes (including “Aces Falling”) and to various BBC “Inside Out” programmes as well as “The One Show”, and "Fake Britain". Many of his written works are published by Grub Street of London, although he has also had one of titles published by the prestigious New York publisher, Random House. He has been involved with military aircraft preservation and recovery for over forty years, including the recovery from India of two World War One bombers for preservation and flight in the UK as well as the wrecks of Gloster Gladiators from Norwegian mountains for UK museum restoration and display. His experience in this sphere over so many years makes him one of the most knowledgeable experts in his field, resulting in frequent demands for input to written works, research, films and documentaries. He is the founder of the Tangmere Military Aviation Museum.
