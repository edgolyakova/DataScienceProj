Biography

Sources vary regarding Bista's date of birth.

Career
While working as a government headmaster in a girls' high school in Patan, Bista became a research assistant to Professor Christoph Furer-Haimendorf of London University who was conducting field research in the area of Solukhumbu. He later claimed that it was this experience that ignited his interest in Anthropology.

He established an organization called Karnali Institute in Jumla. 
In the 1980s, Bista was a member of the board of governors of ICIMOD.
