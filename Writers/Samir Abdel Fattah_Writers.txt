Abdel Fattah is a versatile writer, with a particular interest in European literature, especially that of Russia. He often deals with existential themes and his work is regarded as part of the avant-garde in modern Yemeni literature. In 2009, he teamed up with fellow writers Nadia al-Kokabany, Wajdi al-Ahdal and Ali al-Moqri to form a literary group called Meeting Yesterday. His work has been translated into Italian and was included in an anthology of contemporary Yemeni writers called Perle Dello Yemen (2009).
