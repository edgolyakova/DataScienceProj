He became the features editor for the Neue Zürcher Zeitung in 1892. The following year, he married Emma Karoline Gossweiler (1859-1936), daughter of Adolf Gossweiler, an engineer.

Der König der Bernina (The King of Bernina) was originally filmed in the United States in 1929 (directed by Ernst Lubitsch and starring John Barrymore), under the title Eternal Love. It was filmed again in 1957 (Der König der Bernina) by a Swiss-Austrian coproduction company, and directed by Alfred Lehner. An heiligen Wassern (On Holy Waters) was filmed in Germany in 1932 by Erich Waschneck, under the title Stürzende Wasser (Sacred Water), and again in 1960 by the Swiss director, Alfred Weidenmann (An Heiligen Wassern). Memorials On a hill in Winterthur, there is a "Gedenkstein" (commemorative stone), donated by the city of Poschiavo. In Der König der Bernina the main character, Markus Paltram, is inspired by a hunter and gunsmith named Gian Marchet Colani, who was from that area. Heer is buried nearby. He had originally wanted to be buried in another location closer to town but, by the time he died, a slaughterhouse was being built near there. A second stone was placed in Pontresina, on a spot with a view of the Piz Bernina.
