Biography Born in Scutari in 1872 during the period of Ottoman rule, he left for Serbia where he studied Latin, Old Church Slavonic, Ancient Greek, and ancient history. He graduated from the University of Belgrade in history. For his post-graduate studies he went to the University of Munich, where he received his doctorate. Upon his return to Belgrade, he was named professor at his alma mater. During World War I, Serbia's Minister of Education in-exile in Greece concluded that professors and teachers should be seconded from the army. Nikola Vulić was exempt from further serving in the army in 1917. In Clermont-Ferrand he taught Latin to both Serb and French students.
