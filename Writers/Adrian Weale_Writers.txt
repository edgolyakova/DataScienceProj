Weale was born in Knightsbridge, London. Prior to becoming a professional author, he served as an officer in the British Army Intelligence Corps.  He was compulsorily mobilised for active service in Iraq in May 2003 and from July to December 2003 held the appointment of Deputy Governor of Dhi Qar province in southern Iraq, seconded from the staff of Multi-National Division (South-East) (Iraq) to the Coalition Provisional Authority.

He was succeeded in this role, after an interregnum, by Rory Stewart.
