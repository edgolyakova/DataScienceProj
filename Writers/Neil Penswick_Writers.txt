About Doctor Who: Hostage
Synopsis
The story would feature the Doctor encounter an android war attack on a mission to take out two sinister, shape shifting creatures: Butler and Swarfe.
Production
Penswick submitted the story in 1988, and commissioned Hostage in 1992 to former script editor Andrew Cartmel when he wanted the story to be part of Doctor Who's next season: Season 27, but never made way to screens, due to the BBC announcing since September 1989 that, Doctor Who was to be cancelled after its 26th Season.In Penswick's quote about the story he considered: 

It's about an [sic?] unique group of soldiers, whilst they were searching to stop creatures Butler and Swarfe whom have stolen a weapon and taken it to a jungle. In the end of the first episode, there was a change of the character Swarfe in this monster before Swarfe went hunting in the second episode ... it was Doctor Who: "meets Predator and Aliens" (by a concept)
