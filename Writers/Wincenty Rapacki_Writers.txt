Wincenty Rapacki (22 January 1840, Lipno - 12 January 1924, Warsaw) was a Polish actor and theatre director. Biography He lost his mother at an early age, and his father remarried. His step-family treated him poorly, so he spent much of his time away from home. This led to a fascination with travelling troupes, and his decision to become an actor. After leaving home, he finished his education in Płock then, when he was eighteen, enrolled at the drama school in Warsaw. Unable to find employment there, he went to Druskieniki where, in 1861, he made his début in Stare dzieje (Old History), a comedy by Józef Kraszewski. The 1864/65 season found him in Lwów, and from 1865 to 1870 he was in Kraków. He became a voracious reader, and developed friendships among the intellectuals there, including Kraszewski, Alexander Fredro, Michał Bałucki, Karol Estreicher, and Jan Matejko, who painted his portrait. He also worked in Vienna and Paris; which exposed him to current trends in Western European theatre. In 1869, he performed 11 roles over the course of 37 days at the National Theatre, Warsaw; receiving high praise from the critics. In 1870, he found a permanent position there. During the 1875/76 season, he worked as a director. He also served as an acting teacher. After 1893, he was a lecturer in the diction and declamation class at the Warsaw Music Society. Sometime in the early 1860s, he married the actress and singer, Józefina Hoffman. They had six children. Following her death in 1891, he married Amelia Gordon-Świejkowska (1868-1902).
