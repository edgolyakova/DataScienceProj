"I think it's so easy to extrapolate from this moment as if we know what's going to happen in a week, or a month, or three months, or six months, or a year. And this is one of those situations. The Buddha was always talking about it, of the importance of uncertainty. That really, we don't know what the next moment is going to bring." "For myself, I feel like all those retreats that I've been on, they really help. Because this way of living is so much like being on retreat. You can sort of feel what the weather is going to be the next day, but you don't know much more than that." "In this time when people are much more secluded than they're used to, when they're quarantined, when they're in the home, when they don't quite know what to do with themselves, there's a real opportunity to bring this quality of mindful awareness to the particulars of one's life. There's a real opportunity to be much more alive, and awake, and aware in one's day-to-day life."
