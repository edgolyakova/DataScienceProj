Diederich was born into an Irish-German family in Christchurch, where his father was a barman at the Empire Hotel. The family moved to rural Mākara, near Wellington, when he was 2, and he lived there until he was 16. In 2002 he wrote The Ghosts of Makara: Growing Up Down-Under in a Lost World of Yesteryears about his childhood. He attended Makara Primary School, then Marist Brothers' School in Thorndon and  St Patrick's College for two years in the early 1940s, playing in the 1st XV rugby team and representing the school in boxing.Diederich left school aged 16 to become a shipping clerk to prepare to join the crew of the barque Pamir, which left for San Francisco in early 1943. He was one of 12 boys in a crew of 40. He contributed to the ship's newsletter the Pamir Press.Diederich studied in England in the early postwar years after having participated in World War II in the Pacific. In 1949, Diederich started a sailing trip with two friends that brought him to Haiti, a country that since stayed close to his heart.  He stayed and settled down, while his partners continued their trip. In Port-au-Prince, he founded and edited the Haiti Sun, a weekly English newspaper about Haitian events. As a journalist he also became a freelance correspondent for the Associated Press, The New York Times, and  The Daily Telegraph and others. In 1961 he covered the assassination of Rafael Trujillo in the neighboring Dominican Republic. Two years later, after having displeased Haiti's dictator François "Papa Doc" Duvalier, he was briefly imprisoned and expelled.
