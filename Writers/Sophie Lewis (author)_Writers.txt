Sophie Lewis is a German-British academic and author, known for her radical ideas of family abolition and the use of surrogacy on a societal scale. Lewis has published two books through Verso Books; Full Surrogacy Now: Feminism against the Family, published in 2019, and Abolish the Family: A Manifesto for Care and Liberation, published in October 2022.

Biography
Lewis studied at the University of Oxford, achieving a Bachelor of Arts in English and a master's degree in environmental policy. She completed a master's in politics at The New School in New York City and a PhD at the University of Manchester. Lewis' PhD thesis, entitled Cyborg Labour: Exploring Surrogacy as Gestational Work, focused on the political economy of the surrogacy industry. After completing her PhD, Lewis published her first book, Full Surrogacy Now: Feminism against the Family, which was followed by Abolish the Family: A Manifesto for Care and Liberation in October 2022.
Lewis is based in Philadelphia; she is a visiting scholar at The Center for Research in Feminist, Queer, and Transgender Studies (FQT Center) at the University of Pennsylvania, and teaches at the Philadelphia branch of the Brooklyn Institute for Social Research. Yet, having largely departed from academia, Lewis makes a living as a freelance writer supported by speaking gigs and her Patreon members.

Ideas
In Full Surrogacy Now: Feminism against the Family, Lewis argues that all gestation is inherently work because of the labour it demands from a pregnant person, referring to pregnancy as an "extreme sport". Lewis advocates for a future in which people do not live in the private nuclear households we know today but care for one another in larger systems.
