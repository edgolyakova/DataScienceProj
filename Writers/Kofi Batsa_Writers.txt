However, Batsa was subsequently re-admitted to the CPP and made principal research officer at the Bureau of African Affairs. For a while he was editor of the monthly Voice of Africa. In December 1962 Nkrumah made him editor of The Spark, an intellectual magazine established to "spell out the content of socialism". The Spark criticized the idea of "African socialism", attempting to enunciate a properly "scientific socialism" for an African context. In November 1963 Batsa also became Secretary-General of the Pan-African Union of Journalists (PAUJ).After Nkrumah's fall from power, Batsa moved away from socialism towards capitalism. He returned to politics as an aide to Hilla Limann's 1979–81 government.
