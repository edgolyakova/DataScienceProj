Andrei Stoyanov Gulyashki (Bulgarian: Андрей  Стоянов  Гуляшки) (May 7, 1914 – June 3, 1995) was a Bulgarian writer best known for the exploits of his character, detective Avakoum Zakhov.Avakoum Zakhov first appeared in a 1959 novel Контраразузнаване (reissued as Случаят в Момчилово, translated into English as The Zakhov Mission) and he is the protagonist of several more novels. Western press compared Zakhov with James Bond, and Gulyashki wrote the book about a "match" of Zakhov vs. Bond Avakoum Zahov versus 07, although the name Bond is never mentioned in the book and 007 is replaced with 07, due to copyright issues. The title allegedly lost a zero due to the objections of Ian Fleming's publisher, Glidrose Productions.Gulyashki received several state and literary awards and was member of the National Assembly, the Bulgarian parliament, of 6th, 7th, and 8th convocations.
