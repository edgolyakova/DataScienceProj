Basilio Zanchi (c. 1501 – 1558) was a 16th-century Italian humanist and scholar. Zanchi was born in Bergamo. He wrote his poetry in Latin and was a canon in Letran and later a Vatican librarian. He was imprisoned in Rome because he disobeyed the Pope Paul VI, probably because he accepted some Protestantism theories. He died at Castel Sant'Angelo.
