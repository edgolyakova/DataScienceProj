Percy Redfern Creed (13 May 1874 – November 1964), author of How to Get Things Done, 1938, The Merrymount Press, revised as Getting Things Done, 1946, The Merrymount Press. Biography Born in Dublin, Ireland. Educated in England at Marlborough College (where he held a Classical Scholarship for 5 years) and at Trinity College, Cambridge University (admitted 7 October 1892.) After leaving Cambridge University he entered the British Army. After seven years of service (including service in India and South Africa), he left the Army with the rank of Captain and took a position in the British House of Commons. He left this position to join the staff of The Times newspaper. He gave up newspaper work to accept an invitation from Lord Cromer to act as his Chief of Staff in a National campaign of which Lord Cromer was the Leader. When this campaign was over he accepted an offer from Lord Roberts to act in a similar capacity to him in his famous National Service Campaign.On the outbreak of World War I, he rejoined his regiment, the Rifle Brigade, and was appointed to the Headquarters Staff in the War Office in London. In April 1915 Lord Kitchener sent him forth as his Personal Representative, with a free hand and full responsibility, to force an Emergency Pace and Streamlined Methods in the Production of Munitions. In the course of this mission—which was successfully fulfilled within 3 months—he came into personal contact with King George V, Mr. Henry Asquith (the Prime Minister), and other Leading Men of the day. Thus he had the experience of serving in succession under Lords Cromer, Roberts, and Kitchener—the three Big Men of Action of that generation—with a free hand and full responsibility to carry out their Policies. He moved to America in 1923. Prior to publication of his revised version of his book entitled Getting Things Done, he made an extensive study of American methods of Organization. He served as a Special Consultant in a Government Department in Washington for 14 months. Before going to Washington he worked as a member of a Trade Union in a Defense Plant—12 hours a night, 6 nights a week. In 1925, Creed was interviewed by The Christian Science Monitor. At the time he was a sportswriter. He was interviewed regarding his founding of a "Sportsmanship Brotherhood" in Boston: The object of the brotherhood is "to foster and spread the spirit of sportsmanship throughout the world," and its code of honor—the code of a sportsman—is that he shall:Keep the rules; Keep faith with his comrades, play the game for his side; Keep himself fit; Keep his temper; Keep from hitting a man when he is down; Keep down his pride in victory; Keep a stout heart in defeat accepted with good grace; Keep a sound soul and a clean mind in a healthy body.

Batting at Number 3, he scored 211 runs (out of a team total of 432 runs) and more or less guaranteed that Marlborough would win the match. In the College magazine ("The Marlburian") it described his cricketing abilities as follows: A fine bat with good cutting and driving powers, weak on the leg side, but too indifferent to the game. Fair field, at some times a brilliant one, but too slow in returning the ball.
