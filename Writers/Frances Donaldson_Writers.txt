Frances Annesley (née Lonsdale) (13 January 1907 – 27 March 1994), formally known as Lady Donaldson of Kingsbridge, was a British writer and biographer. Her father was the playwright Freddie Lonsdale.  In 1935, she married John George Stuart Donaldson, who became Baron Donaldson of Kingsbridge in 1967. Her body of work included topics such as farming and biographies on writers Evelyn Waugh and P. G. Wodehouse. During the Second World War she took up farming and made a great success of it, producing record crop and milk yields. She was invited to broadcast in wartime and wrote several books about her experiences.
