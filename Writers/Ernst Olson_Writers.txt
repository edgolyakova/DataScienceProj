Biography
Olson was born to Johannes Olson and Johanna Gran in Mjölkalånga, Finja, Scania, Sweden. Olson emigrated with his parents, four brothers, and five sisters to the United States in 1878.

He was editor of Ungdomsvännen from 1914 to 1918. In 1917, the monthly published a poem by Carl Lönnquist critical of American involvement in World War I, causing an uproar. Olson attempted to calm the readers by speaking of the balance between complying with the government and being allowed to criticize it. He also argued that immigrants were more likely to be patriotic, in contrast to prevailing views seeing them as disloyal. However, Olson was unsuccessful and in the end was forced to leave his position.His writings include A History of the Swedes of Illinois (three volumes, 1908), The Swedish Element in Illinois (1917), Reformation cantata (1917), Pilgrims of the prairie (1929) and contributions to Svenskarna i Amerika (1925).

Olson wrote and translated a number of hymns, including translating "The Sign of the Cross I Triumphantly Bear" ("Ack, saliga stunder", lyrics by Carl Olof Rosenius), "Children of the Heavenly Father" ("Tryggare kan ingen vara", lyrics by Lina Sandell), and "All Hail to Thee, O Blessed Morn!" ("Var hälsad, sköna morgonstund", lyrics by Johan Olof Wallin) to English. He made important contributions to the Augustana Lutheran Church's hymnal, The Hymnal, and served on the committee to produce the Lutheran Service Book and Hymnal.He married Anna Elizabeth Strand in 1899.
