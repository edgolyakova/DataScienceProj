Jacob Frank Schulman (1927–2006) was a U.S. Unitarian Universalist minister, theologian, and author of several books. He held numerous degrees, including a B.A. from the University of Oklahoma, an S.T.B. from Harvard Divinity School, a D.Phil., M.A., and Minister Emeritus Scholar from Oxford University, and an honorary Doctorate of Divinity from Meadville Lombard Theological School. Schulman was the author of several theological and historical books, and specialized particularly in the study of 19th-century religious figures, especially Charles Wellbeloved, Ralph Waldo Emerson, and James Martineau. He was also a minister for most of his life, serving in Youngstown, Ohio, and at Emerson Church in Houston, Texas, for 25 years, in addition to many other churches, some in England. Schulman served as a teacher to ministry students at Manchester College at Oxford University from 1989–1996. In retirement he served as the first minister for a small congregation in Huntsville, Texas, which has become Thoreau Woods Unitarian-Universalist Church.
