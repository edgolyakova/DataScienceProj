Reception In her 2009 book The Best Horror of the Year, Volume 1, Ellen Datlow called Jones's anthology of short stories, The Strange Cases of Rudolph Pearson "a clever and entertaining collection of ten interrelated stories of Lovecraftian fiction."Pamela Kinney said of Jones's novel Pallid Light: The Walking Dead that she needed more background on the protagonist to better understand his motivations, and she also wanted Jones to "Flesh out the story, making it more than the world coming to an end." Despite these points, she rated the book 4 stars out of five, saying, "If you’re looking for a good zombie story to read this winter, this would be the one to get. Just beware: if it’s raining, check for odd lights in the sky. And lock your doors and windows."
