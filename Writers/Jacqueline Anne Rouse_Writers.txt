She co-edited a 1990 volume titled Women in the Civil Rights Movement: Trailblazers and Torchbearers, 1941-1965. In a review of the book published in the journal Gender & Society, Paulette Pierce called Women in the Civil Rights Movement a "long-awaited correction to the masculinist bias that has systematically distorted our understanding of the Black movement."Rouse was a member of the Association of Black Women Historians for over 30 years and served as the organization's National Director in the mid-1990s. She was the president of the Association of Social and Behavioral Scientists in 1991-1992.

In March 2015, Rouse was among the group of scholars who were honored at an event called "BWHxG: Cross-Generational Dialogues in Black Women’s History" at Michigan State University.
