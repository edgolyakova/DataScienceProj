Charles Bindley (1795/6–1859) was a British sporting writer, who concentrated on horses and field sports, particularly hunting and stable management. He became known under his pseudonym, Harry Hieover.

Life
On his own account, Bindley's background included a fox-hunting father, service in Ireland, and sojourns mainly in Leicestershire and Lincolnshire. He wrote for a number of major sporting periodicals. In November 1858, in poor health, he left London for Brighton, where he was the guest of his friend Sir Thomas Barrett-Lennard, 2nd Baronet. He died there on 10 February 1859, aged 63.
