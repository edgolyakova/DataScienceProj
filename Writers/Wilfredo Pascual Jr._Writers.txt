Awards Winner, 2015 Curt Johnson Prize for Nonfiction Notable Citation, 2016 Best American Essays "You Have Me" December Literary Journal, Issue 26.2 2015 Judge and acclaimed poet Albert Goldbarth hailed its "durable, clear, grammatically sophisticated sentences... The prose here is smart and relies not on loose imagery but on tight declaration. Its mix of research into the sciences (heredity, genetics) and recounting of the personal (a father's death, a son's marriage) are savvily and seamlessly twined." Runner-up, 2016 Steinberg Essay Prize "Terminus" Fourth Genre, forthcoming February 2017 Judge and essayist Ned Stuckey French: "... wonderfully written, very affecting... it illuminated its subject -- gay life in a global context -- in a way I at least have not seen before." Nominated for the 2016 Pushcart Prize and 2016 Best of the Net "Animalia" Your Impossible Voice, Fall 2015. A personal essay that gathers the author's most meaningful encounters with the animal kingdom in San Francisco, Thailand, and the Philippines. First Place, Essay, Philippine Free Press Literary Awards. "Lost and Bloodletting in Mount Kitchakut" Philippine Free Press, 2008. While ostensibly a first-person account of a near-disastrous hiking trip on the slopes of a mountain in Thailand, the author elevates it to a rumination on identity, family, and nation. Using a funny, absurd episode involving leeches as a take-off point, he proceeds to examine the layers of meaning embedded in this unusual incident, and filters them through the multi-faceted sensibilities of a Filipino-writer-son-exile, turning the event into a metaphor for his own search for an ever-elusive sense of home. At once deeply personal and starkly universal, this essay tempers its quiet reflections with a worldly wisdom that is pointed without being cynical, elegiac without being regretful.

"Devotion" Philippine Studies, Vol. 53, Nos. 2 and 3 After many years abroad, the author returns to his country to meet the woman whose art and life inspired him. A personal essay on fandom in the Philippines. Judge: Conrado de Quiros Other writings "Devotion 2" Kritika Kultura 25 (2015) Abstract: In 2004, the author spent a week with fans of Nora Aunor in New York during the Philippine Superstar's U.S. concert tour. This personal essay is a ruminative account of a wayfaring trip that began the year before when the author flew to Manila and met the star for the first time. It's a pilgrimage of sorts, tracking the wandering icon in Manhattan, from her hotel bedroom to Times Square all the way to the airport. It crosses time and space from aquatic Bicol and Atlantic City to mystical Byzantine times and the tumultuous years of the Marcos dictatorship. It grapples with symbols and stories, the faith and powers at work in the act of devotion; how, collectively, the fans mirror a nation's hopes for radical transformation, at home or elsewhere â€“ a journey that ends with a stirring personal message from Nora Aunor.
