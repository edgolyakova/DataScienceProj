In 1937 he published Deux Franciscians: Adam et Franz Liszt and in December of that year published La Probleme Liszt. The essay, which is a deep exploration of the musicality of Liszt, established Haraszti as one of the foremost Liszt scholars of his generation.Haraszti famously criticized composer Béla Bartók for lacking interest in Hungarian music, describing him as "becoming an apostle of Czech, Romanian and Slovak music".
