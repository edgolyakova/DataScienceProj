He has received the Tómas Guðmundsson Award, Halldór Laxness Literature Award, and in 1996 was nominated for the Icelandic Literature Prize.Bjarni's early work was self-published, and did not receive much attention. However, his 1996 novel Endurkoma Maríu ('The Return of Mary) was a critical success: 'the novel is a fantastic tale of an unusually talented young woman and an unusual young man who loves her from afar. It takes place in several cities that show distinct similarities to certain European cities but are clearly illusory spaces'.In the estimation of Ástráður Eysteinsson and Úfhildur Dagsdóttir, 'Time is an important element in all his novels; their imagery is influenced by ancient myths and invested with a fairy tale atmosphere while simultaneously referring to modern phenomena.'
