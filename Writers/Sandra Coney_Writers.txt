The article and the subsequent inquiry are seen as a turning point in healthcare ethics in New Zealand.Coney has been involved in other women's health causes, and in 1984 co-founded with Bunkle Women's Health Action to co-ordinate claims by women who had been injured by the Dalkon Shield IUD.

She wrote a regular column of political and social comment for the Sunday-Times for 16 years from 1986. She is also involved in the local politics of the Piha area such as the unsuccessful campaign against the Piha cafe. She has also written an history of Piha, and is currently researching Anzac soldiers from the Piha area.
