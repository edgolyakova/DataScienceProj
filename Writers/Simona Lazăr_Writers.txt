The Award of Excellence in Journalism at the Gala of the Union of Professional Journalists of Romania for 2015, the jury thus motivating the award given: “The guests of Simona Nicoleta Lazar always surprise by a reversal of the conveniences. Listening to them, you cannot miss a gymnastics exercise of the mind. I have watched it in countless radio editions and I have never been able to decode that magic ritual by which it manages to cause its interlocutor to release the unspoken thoughts until then. Her shows have great merit that make you listen. To accept. Think and talk. Simona Nicoleta Lazăr - the prize for excellence in journalism for the rediscovery and popularization of the spiritual, traditional and identity treasure of the Romanian village.” AJTR 2017, granted for the program "Holiday Ticket" from Romanian Radio Antena Satelor Broadcast.
