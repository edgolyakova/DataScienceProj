Early life

Career
Rajah took over stewardship of the Makaibari Tea Estate in 1970. Under his guardianship, Makaibari was the first garden amongst Darjeeling's 87 tea gardens to become completely organic. Subsequently, he also converted Makaibari into bio-dynamic status, on the basis of the philosophy of Rudolf Steiner.Over the next decade, Rajah mentored a number of Darjeeling tea gardens like Longview Tea Estate and converted them into organic as well. During this period Rajah had numerous films and documentaries made about him and his practices at Makaibari. These included focusing on women's empowerment through the homestay initiative, improving education and health facilities for the community members, increasing the overall income levels of the community members through biodynamic practices. These initiatives were supported by the Makaibari Joint Body (MBJB). Rajah also focused on ensuring that Makaibari was a space open for research, art, and culture. The filmmaker Chaitanya Tamhane's first film "Six Strands" was in fact shot at Makaibari in 2011. In addition to that, multiple research papers and dissertations have been written by students during their time volunteering or interning at Makaibari.
In 2014, Rajah sold the majority of his ownership of the Makaibari Garden to the Kolkata-based Luxmi group. However, in 2017, he had a disagreement with them about management practices. Later that year, his heritage bungalow at the garden burnt down, and subsequently he exited the tea estate, and relinquished all management control.In 2018, Rajah started an artisanal tea brand known as Rimpocha, in order to mentor small growers of Darjeeling. In 2020, he became the founding chairman of the Selim Hill Collective, in order to revive the heritage Selim Hill Tea Garden of Darjeeling, and undertake a next management makeover for the tea estate.
