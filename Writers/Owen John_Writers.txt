Leonard Owen-John (1 May 1918 â€“ 23 January 1995) was a Welsh author of spy fiction who is mostly remembered for his series of novels starring the Russian-born MI-6 agent Haggai Godin.
Praised by his comparatively realistic approach to the world of espionage, he has been called by critics "a master of the double cross".
