Brian Plummer, also known as David Brian Plummer (11 September 1936 – 12 September 2003), was a British writer, teacher and dog breeder. Background In 1977, Plummer appeared on Richard Whiteley's Calendar regional news programme, during which a ferret became 'latched' onto Whiteley's fingers. A blasé Plummer showed little concern for the pain Whiteley was in, instead telling him that if the ferret had been serious the bite would have been "through to the bone. He's playing with you." Growing up in the austere years around World War II, Plummer based some of his biographical stories in and around the valley in which he grew up. Some of the stories involve friends, members of the village community, and bizarre members of his own family.After a stint of National Service, Plummer trained to be a teacher and worked in various areas of the United Kingdom, including Rotherham and Walsall. In his books he hints at various 'episodes' in his life including a couple of abortive spells of self-sufficiency, a period of travel abroad as a gamekeeper in Germany and Eastern Europe, some time as a professional boxer in America, and various periods of deep depression. Documentaries The UK television documentary maker Barry Cockcroft made several documentaries about Plummer, including A Way Out of Walsall (1985), which is about Plummer's training pupils of the local Forest Comprehensive School for the world of professional boxing, and Lone Furrow (1987), which looks at the preoccupation of Plummer with his dogs, which have been rat-catchers, and his current wish to cross the Highlands pulled by a pack of German shepherd dogs. Another producer, Michael Croucher, made a 1981 documentary entitled Hunting Man about Plummer, formerly a full-time hunter and later a teacher and writer, who at that time still hunted in the fast-disappearing countryside around Birmingham. Dog breeding The Plummer Terrier, a breed of dog that he developed, is named after him. Death After suffering a heart attack in 1985, Plummer moved to Caithness with a plan to breed German shepherd dogs, then finally settled in Abington, in Lanarkshire. He died on 12 September 2003.
